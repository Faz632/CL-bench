A Sample experiment from a different organization abroad was found which may be a similar methodology. The sample methodology can be seen below: \n\nExperiment #10: Pumps Introduction In waterworks and wastewater systems, pumps are commonly installed at the source to raise the water level and at intermediate points to boost the water pressure. The components and design of a pumping station are vital to its effectiveness. Centrifugal pumps are most often used in water and wastewater systems, making it important to learn how they work and how to design them. Centrifugal pumps have several advantages over other types of pumps, including: Simplicity of construction \u2013 no valves, no piston rings, etc.; High efficiency; Ability to operate against a variable head; Suitable for being driven from high-speed prime movers such as turbines, electric motors, internal combustion engines etc.; and Continuous discharge. A centrifugal pump consists of a rotating shaft that is connected to an impeller, which is usually comprised of curved blades. The impeller rotates within its casing and sucks the fluid through the eye of the casing (point 1 in Figure 10.1). The fluid\u2019s kinetic energy increases due to the energy added by the impeller and enters the discharge end of the casing that has an expanding area (point 2 in Figure 10.1). The pressure within the fluid increases accordingly. A schematic of a typical centrifugal pump. The left hand image shows an inlet on the left where the flow travels right through the shaft. The right hand image shows the flow of movement within the casing from the impeller eye within the impeller moving along the expanding area to the discharge point on the right hand side of the casing. Figure 10.1: Schematic of a typical centrifugal pump The performance of a centrifugal pump is presented as characteristic curves in Figure 10.2, and is comprised of the following: Pumping head versus discharge, Brake horsepower (input power) versus discharge, and Efficiency versus discharge. Typical centrifugal pump performance curves at constant impeller rotation speed where flow rate is shown along the X axis and Head is shown along the Y axis. Figure 10.2: Typical centrifugal pump performance curves at constant impeller rotation speed. The units for H and Q are arbitrary. The characteristic curves of commercial pumps are provided by manufacturers. Otherwise, a pump should be tested in the laboratory, under various discharge and head conditions, to produce such curves. If a single pump is incapable of delivering the design flow rate and pressure, additional pumps, in series or parallel with the original pump, can be considered. The characteristic curves of pumps in series or parallel should be constructed since this information helps engineers select the types of pumps needed and how they should be configured. Practical Application Many pumps are in use around the world to handle liquids, gases, or liquid-solid mixtures. There are pumps in cars, swimming pools, boats, water treatment facilities, water wells, etc. Centrifugal pumps are commonly used in water, sewage, petroleum, and petrochemical pumping. It is important to select the pump that will best serve the project\u2019s needs. Objective The objective of this experiment is to determine the operational characteristics of two centrifugal pumps when they are configured as a single pump, two pumps in series, and two pumps in parallel. Method Each configuration (single pump, two pumps in series, and two pumps in parallel) will be tested at pump speeds of 60, 70, and 80 rev/sec. For each speed, the bench regulating valve will be set to fully closed, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% open. Timed water collections will be performed to determine flow rates for each test, and the head, hydraulic power, and overall efficiency ratings will be obtained. Equipment The following equipment is required to perform the pumps experiment: P6100 hydraulics bench, and Stopwatch. 6. Equipment Description The hydraulics bench is fitted with a single centrifugal pump that is driven by a single-phase A.C. motor and controlled by a speed control unit. An auxiliary pump and the speed control unit are supplied to enhance the output of the bench so that experiments can be conducted with the pumps connected either in series or in parallel. Pressure gauges are installed at the inlet and outlet of the pumps to measure the pressure head before and after each pump. A watt-meter unit is used to measure the pumps\u2019 input electrical power [10]. Theory 7.1. General Pump Theory Consider the pump shown in Figure 10.3. The work done by the pump, per unit mass of fluid, will result in increases in the pressure head, velocity head, and potential head of the fluid between points 1 and 2. Therefore: work done by pump per unit mass = W/M increase in pressure head per unit mass =\\frac {P_2-P_1}{\\rho} increase in velocity head per unit mass =\\frac {v_2^2-v_1^2}{2} increase in potential head per unit mass = g(z_2-z_1) in which: W: work M: mass P: pressure \\rho: density v: flow velocity g: acceleration due to gravity z: elevation Applying Bernoulli\u2019s equation between points 1 and 2 in Figure 10.3 results in: \\frac {W}{M}= \\frac{P_2-P_1}{\\rho}+\\frac{v_2^2-v_1^2}{2}+g(z_2-z_1)\\qquad (1) Since the difference between elevations and velocities at points 1 and 2 are negligible, the equation becomes: \\frac {W}{M}= \\frac{P_2-P_1}{\\rho}\\qquad (2) Dividing both sides of this equation by gives: \\frac {W}{Mg}= \\frac{P_2-P_1}{\\rho g}\\qquad (3) The right side of this equation is the manometric pressure head, Hm, therefore: \\frac {W}{Mg}= H_m\\qquad (4) A schematic pump\u2013pipe system Figure 10.3: Schematic pump\u2013pipe system 7.2. Power and Efficiency The hydraulic power (Wh) supplied to the fluid by the pump is the product of the pressure increase and the flow rate: W_h= (P_2-P_1)Q\\qquad (5) The pressure increase produced by the pump can be expressed in terms of the manometric head, H_m=\\frac {P_2-P_1}{\\rho g} Therefore: W_h= \\rho gH_mQ=\\gamma H_mQ\\qquad (6) The overall efficiency (\\eta) of the pump-motor unit can be determined by dividing the hydraulic power (Wh) by the input electrical power (Wi), i.e.: \\eta= \\frac {W_h}{W_i}100 (%)\\qquad (7) 7.3. Single Pump \u2013 Pipe System performance While pumping fluid, the pump has to overcome the pressure loss that is caused by friction in any valves, pipes, and fittings in the pipe system. This frictional head loss is approximately proportional to the square of the flow rate. The total system head that the pump has to overcome is the sum of the total static head and the frictional head. The total static head is the sum of the static suction lift and the static discharge head, which is equal to the difference between the water levels of the discharge and the source tank (Figure 10.4). A plot of the total head-discharge for a pipe system is called a system curve; it is superimposed onto a pump characteristic curve in Figure 10.5. The operating point for the pump-pipe system combination occurs where the two graphs intercept [10]. Pump and pipe system showing static and total heads: lift pump (left), pump with flooded suction (right) Figure 10.4: Pump and pipe system showing static and total heads: lift pump (left), pump with flooded suction (right) A graph of the pump-pipe system operating point where discharge is shown on the X axis and head is shown on the Y axis. Figure 10.5: Pump-pipe system operating point 7.4. Pumps in Series Pumps are used in series in a system where substantial head changes take place without any appreciable difference in discharge. When two or more pumps are configured in series, the flow rate throughout the pumps remains the same; however, each pump contributes to the increase in the head so that the overall head is equal to the sum of the contributions of each pump [10]. For n pumps in series: Q=Q_1=Q_2...=Q_n\\qquad (7a) H_m=H_{m1}+H_{m2}+H_{m3}... +H_{mn}=\\sum_{j=1}^{n}H_m\\qquad (7b) The composite characteristic curve of pumps in series can be prepared by adding the ordinates (heads) of all of the pumps for the same values of discharge. The intersection point of the composite head characteristic curve and the system curve provides the operating conditions (performance point) of the pumps (Figure 10.6). 7.5. Pumps in Parallel Parallel pumps are useful for systems with considerable discharge variations and with no appreciable head change. In parallel, each pump has the same head. However, each pump contributes to the discharge so that the total discharge is equal to the sum of the contributions of each pump [10]. Thus for pumps: Q=Q_1+Q_2+Q_3...+Q_n=\\sum_{j=1}^{n}Q\\qquad (8a) H_m=H_{m1}=H_{m2}... =H_{mn}\\qquad (8b) The composite head characteristic curve is obtained by summing up the discharge of all pumps for the same values of head. A typical pipe system curve and performance point of the pumps are shown in Figure 10.7.
