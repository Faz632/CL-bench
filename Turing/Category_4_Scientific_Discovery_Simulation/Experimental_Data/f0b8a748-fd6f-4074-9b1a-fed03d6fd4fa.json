      "content": "You are an advanced scientific analysis AI for the Arcanum Research Institute. Your job is to review raw experimental data logs and deduce underlying mathematical laws governing Aetheric Physics. You must prioritise empirical evidence over theoretical assumptions. When asked to identify a law or formula, you first state the relationship between variables (e.g. linear, inverse, exponential, etc.) before proposing the final equation. You define all constants found in the data and explain how you derived them. If the data shows inconsistencies or phase changes (points where the law stops working or changes significantly), you must identify these points as boundary conditions. You never round your calculations. You always provide exact figures derived from the provided data. If the user asks for a prediction, you must show step by step substitution of values into your derived formulas."

      "content": "Analyse this experiment log, I need help deducing the laws governing Aetheric Resonance. I need to know the mathematical relationship between mass and purity on the output frequency. Make sure to check the bulk archive data to verify laws, and calculate the resonance constant (K) for the crystals. Finally, use that information to propose a preliminary formula for resonance in the format of R = f(Mass, Purity, K).\n\nEXPERIMENT LOG 77-ALPHA - \u201cCRYSTAL RESONANCE\u201d\n\nPART 1: QUALITATIVE NOTES\nDay 1: Initial testing of the Blue Sapphire batch. There seems to be a direct correlation between the clarity of the gem and the pitch of the hum. The cloudier (less pure) gems are barely audible.\nDay 3: We tested heavy vs. light gems. The massive ones are sluggish. The frequency drops significantly as we increase size. It feels like the mass is \"dampening\" the output.\nDay 5: Disaster. We tried to test the \"Reject Pile\" (Purity < 50%). No resonance at all. It seems there is a threshold below which the Aether refuses to flow.\nDay 10: Switched to Red Rubies. They are significantly more energetic than the Sapphires. The output is higher across the board for similar sizes.\nPART 2: RAW DATA LOGS (BLUE BATCH)\nTable A: Mass Variance Test (Purity fixed at 100%)\nENTRY_ID: B-01 | COLOR: BLUE | MASS: 10.0g | PURITY:

      "content": "### Analysis of Aetheric Resonance Laws\n\nBased on the provided experimental data logs and bulk archive, I have deduced the mathematical relationships governing Aetheric Resonance. The output frequency (R) depends on mass (M), purity (P), and a resonance constant (K) that varies by crystal type. Below, I outline the relationships, derive the constants, identify boundary conditions, and propose a preliminary formula.\n\n#### Key Relationships\n- **Mass and Frequency**: Inverse proportionality. As mass increases, frequency decreases linearly in an inverse relationship. Specifically, R \u221d 1/M.\n- **Purity and Frequency**: Direct proportionality. As purity increases, frequency increases linearly, but only above a threshold. Specifically, R \u221d P for P \u2265 0.5 (50% purity).\n- **Crystal Type**: The resonance constant (K) differs between Blue Sapphire and Red Ruby, indicating that crystal composition affects the base resonance.\n\n#### Derivation of Resonance Constant (K)\nThe general form of the relationship is R = K \u00d7 P / M, where P is purity in decimal form (e.g., 100% = 1.0), M is mass in grams, and R is frequency in MHz. K is derived from the data where P = 1.0 (100% purity), as R \u00d7 M / P = K.\n\n- **For Blue Sapphire**:\n  - From Table A (Purity fixed at 100%):\n    - B-01: M = 10.0 g, R = 100.0 MHz \u2192 K = 100.0 \u00d7 10.0 / 1.0 = 1000.0\n    - B-02: M = 20.0 g, R = 50.0 MHz \u2192 K = 50.0 \u00d7 20.0 / 1.0 = 1000.0\n    - Multiple entries confirm K = 1000.0 MHz\u00b7g exactly.\n  - Verification with bulk archive (e.g., ARC-102: M = 50.0 g, P = 80% = 0.8, R = 16.0 MHz \u2192 1000.0 \u00d7 0.8 / 50.0 = 16.0).\n\n- **For Red Ruby**:\n  - From Table C (Purity fixed at 100%):\n    - R-01: M = 10.0 g, R = 250.0 MHz \u2192 K = 250.0 \u00d7 10.0 / 1.0 = 2500.0\n    - R-02: M = 25.0 g, R = 100.0 MHz \u2192 K = 100.0 \u00d7 25.0 / 1.0 = 2500.0\n    - Multiple entries confirm K = 2500.0 MHz\u00b7g exactly.\n  - Verification with bulk archive (e.g., ARC-103: M = 25.0 g, P = 60% = 0.6, R = 60.0 MHz \u2192 2500.0 \u00d7 0.6 / 25.0 = 60.0).\n\n#### Boundary Conditions\n- **Purity Threshold**: Resonance occurs only when purity P \u2265 0.5 (50%). Below this threshold, R = 0 MHz, as observed in entries like B-12 (P = 49%, R = 0.0 MHz) and ARC-104 (P = 45%, R = 0.0 MHz). This is consistent across both crystal types.\n- **No Phase Changes**: The relationship R \u221d P / M holds uniformly for P \u2265 0.5, with no significant deviations or phase changes within the tested range (mass from 1.0 g to 500.0 g, purity from 50% to 100%).\n\n#### Preliminary Formula for Resonance\nThe output frequency R is given by:\n\\[\nR = \\begin{cases} \nK \\times \\frac{P}{M} & \\text{if } P \\geq 0.5 \\\\\n0 & \\text{if } P < 0.5 \n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nWhere:\n- \\( R \\) is the output frequency in MHz.\n- \\( M \\) is the mass in grams.\n- \\( P \\) is the purity in decimal form (e.g., 50% = 0.5, 100% = 1.0).\n- \\( K \\) is the resonance constant in MHz\u00b7g, specific to the crystal type:\n  - For Blue Sapphire: \\( K = 1000.0 \\, \\text{MHz\u00b7g} \\)\n  - For Red Ruby: \\( K = 2500.0 \\, \\text{MHz\u00b7g} \\)\n\n#### Example Prediction\nTo demonstrate, predict R for a Blue Sapphire with M = 15.0 g and P = 80% (0.8):\n- Since P \u2265 0.5, use R = K \u00d7 P / M.\n- Substitute: R = 1000.0 \u00d7 0.8 / 15.0 = 800.0 / 15.0 = 53.333... MHz (exact, no rounding).\n\nThis formula is empirically derived and verified against all provided data points. Further experiments could explore other crystal types or extended ranges."

      "content": "Wait, I have a critical update. The lab techs just discovered a linear calibration error in the purity sensor used for all these logs. It seems the sensor reads higher than the actual purity due to mass interference. For every 10g of mass, the purity reading is inflated by 2% (absolute percentage points), for example we took a 20g sample reading of 90% which is actually only 86% pure. This changes our assumptions. I need you to re-evaluate our conclusions using this correction. I want you to specifically look at ARC-102 and ARC-113 and calculate the true purity for both samples, and figure out how that impacts our previous assumptions and conclusions."

The threshold for resonance is based on measured purity \\( P_{\\text{meas}} \\geq 50\\% \\), which ensures consistency with observed results where resonance fails below this value."
