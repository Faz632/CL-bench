      "content": "Hey Mako, I'm trying to read the massive Bay of plenty regional council report about this new marine protected area they've set up. How many hectares will be no-fish zones in the bay of plenty now?\n\n1.0 Introduction\nThe appeal to the Proposed Regional Coastal Environment Plan (2015) requesting the BOPRC\nprovide greater protection (with a focus on fishing restrictions) for Outstanding Natural Features\nand Landscapes around Motiti Island was novel. Regional Councils around New Zealand had\nnot been asked to manage fishing until this time.\nThe High Court and Court of Appeal agreed that Regional Councils can manage fishing in order\nto protect indigenous biodiversity values in their region.\nIn May 2018 the Environment Court (Decision No. [2018] NZEnvC 067; 11 May 2018) released\nan interim decision directing three areas for protection (Section A1):\n\u201cThe damage, destruction, removal of flora and fauna within the three marked areas of\nthe Motiti Natural Environment Management Area (MNEMA) in the Bay of Plenty\nproposed Regional Coastal Environment Plan (PRCEP) shall be prohibited.\u201d\nThe final decision on the Motiti Protection Areas was released by the Environment Court on 24\nApril 2020 (Decision No. [2020] NZEnvC 050; 24 April 2020). BOPRC are now required to\nprepare new rules in the Regional Coastal Environment Plan to protect the three reef systems\n(see\nFigure 1-1), including undertaking additional monitoring to inform future integrated marine\nmanagement solutions. The taking of organisms from the three Motiti Protection Areas will be\nprohibited in a couple of months once the new rules have been established, approved by the\nMinister for Conservation and inserted into the Regional Coastal Plan1.\nThe three protection areas are focused on high value reef systems around Motiti Island including:\nOtaiti (Astrolabe Reef; including Te Papa (Brewis Shoal), Te Poroiti, and Okarapu), Motuhaku\nIsland (Schooner Rocks), and Motunau Island (Plate Island) (\nFigure 1-1). The Bay of Plenty Regional Council have the responsibility to protect the flora and\nfauna around Motiti Island in three marked protected areas as per section A1 of the court ruling (\nFigure 1-1). The Motiti Protection Areas will be no take protected areas, where flora and fauna\nremoval will be prohibited. The Bay of Plenty Regional Council (BOPRC) sought a comprehensive\nreview and compilation of the current scientific knowledge in the Motiti Natural Environment\nManagement Area and Motiti Protection Areas and assist their management of those areas.\nThe three Motiti Protection Areas focus on high value reef systems (\nFigure 1-1);\n\u2022 Otaiti (Astrolabe), Te Papa (Brewis Shoal), Te Poroiti and Okarapu (often incorrectly\ncalled Okaparu)\n\u2022 Motuhaku Island (Schooner Rocks)\n\u2022 Motunau (Plate Island) and Tokoroa\nThis report provides a summary of the existing information, collated geo-spatial data where it was\navailable, identifies research gaps and future research priorities that will fulfil BOPRC\n\nresponsibility to protect the biodiversity and values of the Motiti Natural Environment Management\nArea and Motiti Protection Areas.\n3.0 Coastal Habitats of the Bay of Plenty\nIn 2008, the Department of Conservation (DOC) commissioned scientific research by help identify\ncoastal marine habitats as potential components of a network of marine protected areas (Haggitt\net al. 2008). The project had two main objectives. The first, to classify habitats across estuarine\nand marine environments in accordance with the Marine Protected Areas classification protection\nstandard and implementation guidelines within the Bay of Plenty region (Figure 3-1). The Marine\nProtected Area classification, protection standard and implementation guidelines developed by\nthe Ministry of Fisheries and the Department of Conservation identified a total of 43 habitat types\ndependent on environment, depth, and exposure classes. The second objective was to provide a\nmeasure of certainty/confidence relating to the habitat classification (Haggitt et al. 2008).\nThe Bay of Plenty Coastal Marine Area (CMA \u2013 estuarine and marine) was assigned to a total of\n10 Marine Protected Area habitat classes. These varied considerably in spatial extent (percent\ncover) across the region (Figure 3-1,Table 3-1).).\nTable 3-1 Percent cover and corresponding number of grid cells for estuarine (intertidal and subtidal) and marine (intertidal, shallow\nsubtidal, and deep subtidal) environments across the Bay of Plenty (from Haggitt et al. 2008).\nEstuarine Habitat Percent Cover (total # of 200m3 cells)\nIntertidal Subtidal\nMud flat 2.57 (n=6,351)\nSand flat 0.39 (n=963)\nMarine Habitat Percent Cover (total # of 200m3 cells)\nIntertidal Shallow Subtidal Deep Subtidal\nGravel beach 0.01 (n=17)\nShallow sand 11.44 (n=28,232)\nShallow rocky reef 1.38 (n=3,406)\nShallow gravel field 1.57 (n=3,876)\nUnknown 3.38 (n=8,332)\nDeep sand 67.04 (n=165,472)\nDeep mud 7.28 (n=17,971)\nDeep gravel field 4.23 (n=10,439)\nDeep rocky reef 0.72 (n=1,773)\nIntertidal and subtidal estuarine areas such as Tauranga Harbour and Ohiwa Harbour, were\ndominated by intertidal mudflats, followed by subtidal sand flat habitat in main channel areas.\nShallow subtidal regions (< 30m depth \u2013 Medium exposure) were characterised by extensive\nsand habitat (c. 80 % of the shallow subtidal area), interspersed with gravel and shallow rocky\nreef habitat (both c.10 % of the shallow subtidal area). Gravel fields were spatially dominant in\nthe western Bay of Plenty shallow subtidal, with shallow rocky reef forming a relatively continuous\nband along the coastline east of Opotiki out to Cape Runaway. Shallow rocky reef also occurred\nin isolated patches in central and western areas of the Bay of Plenty region (Figure 3-1).\nCommon habitats in deeper subtidal regions (> 30m depth \u2013 low exposure) were sand, gravel\npatches, rocky reef and mud. Of these, sand was ubiquitous (c. 85% of the deep subtidal),\nwhereas mud habitat (10% of the deep subtidal) was spatially variable being abundant east of\nWhite Island, in the central Bay of Plenty region and in the north-west tip of the survey boundary.\nGravel patches occurred across the entire region accounting for around 5% of the deep subtidal\narea, with deep rocky reef considerably lower in spatial extent (< 1%) (Figure 3-1).\nIntertidal marine environments were dominated by sand and gravel beach habitats, however due\nto the survey cell size used for analysis (i.e. 200m2), these and other habitats such as intertidal\nrocky platforms could not be adequately represented.\nIn November 2012, Kulgemeyer et al. (2016) mapped and analysed the sediment dynamics of\nthe western Bay of Plenty using a newly developed multi-sensor benthic profiler MARUM\nNERIDIS III. An area of 60km \u00d7 7km between 2 and 35m water depth was surveyed with this\nbottom-towed sled equipped with a high-resolution camera for continuous close-up seafloor\nphotography and a conductivity temperature depth meter with a connected turbidity sensor. This\nmulti-parameter dataset was combined with sidescan sonography and sedimentological analyses\nto create detailed lithofacies and bedform distribution maps and to derive regional sediment\ntransport patterns (Figure 3-2).\nFor the assessment of sediment distribution, photographs were classified, and their spatial\ndistribution mapped out according to associated acoustic backscatter from a sidescan sonar. This\nprovisional map was used to choose target locations for surficial sediment sampling and\nsubsequent laboratory analysis of grain size distribution and mineralogical composition. Finally,\nphotographic, granulometric and mineralogical facies were combined into a unified lithofacies\nmap and corresponding stratigraphic model.\nEight distinct types of lithofacies with seawards increasing grain size were discriminated and\ninterpreted as reworked relict deposits overlain by post-transgressional fluvial sediments (Figure\n3-3). The dominant transport processes in different water depths were identified based on type\nand orientation of bed forms, as well as bottom water turbidity and lithofacies distribution.\nObserved bedforms include subaquatic dunes, coarse sand ribbons and sorted bedforms of\nvarying dimensions, which were interpreted as being initially formed by erosion. Under fair\nweather conditions, sediment is transported from the northwest towards the southeast by littoral \n\ndrift. During storm events, a current from the southeast to the northwest is induced which is\ntransporting sediment along the shore in up to 35m water depth. Shorewards oriented crossshore transport is taking place in up to 60m water depth and is likewise initiated by storm events\n(Figure 3-2).\n3.1 Marine Protected Areas and Monitoring in the Bay of\nPlenty\nThere are two marine protected areas in the Bay of Plenty. The Tuhua (Mayor Island; 1,060 ha)\nMarine Reserve established in 1993, and the Te Paepae o Aotea (Volkner Rocks; 1,267 ha)\nMarine Reserve established in 2006. Neither of these marine protected areas has been monitored\nby the Department of Conservation to the same extent as other marine reserves, such as Poor\nKnights Islands, Cape Rodney-Okakarei Point (Goat Island), Tawharanui or Whanganui-A-Hei\n(Cathedral Cove).\nThe Department of Conservation has worked with the Tuhua Trust Board and Dr Keith Gregor\n(and Marine Studies students) of Toi Ohomai (formerly the Bay of Plenty Polytechnic) to monitor\nfish populations in the marine reserve at Tuhua (Mayor Island). In the most recent report (Morrison\nand Gregor 2012), it is noted that snapper populations in the marine reserve have increased in\nsize and abundance between 2004 and 2011. Prior to 2011, there was no evidence of snapper\npopulations having increased inside the marine reserve (Young et al. 2006).\nShears et al. (2008) reported on ecological responses in the Tuhua marine reserve in a paper\nexamining the effects of fishing on food web dynamics across marine protected areas on the\nnorth-east coast of New Zealand. It was noted that when surveys were conducted (March 2000)\nthere was no evidence that snapper or crayfish were more abundant within the Tuhua Marine\nReserve relative to unprotected areas. This is consistent with earlier findings of (Young et al.\n2006). Shears et al. (2008) also reported no significant difference in the coverage of urchin\nbarrens habitat or macroalgal biomass in fished vs. protected area. Details on the benthic ecology\nof Tuhua, including macroalgal and invertebrate biodiversity, are reported in Shears and Babcock\n(2007).\nUnderwater visual surveys of fishes, mobile invertebrates and sessile biota were undertaken at\nTuhua and Te Paepae o Aotea in 2012 and 2013 as part of a larger survey (Edgar et al. 2017).\nusing the Reef Life Survey methodology (Edgar and Stuart-Smith 2014). Tuhua was unusual\namong the six reserves examined in that urchin densities were not lower within the protected area\n(vs. the fished survey sites). Coverage of Ecklonia was reported as being greater at within\nsurveyed reserves sites at both Tuhua and Te Paepae o Aotea. Few crayfish were observed at\neither location.\n4.0 Motiti Protection Area containing Otaiti,\nOkarapu Reef, Te Poroiti and Te Papa\n(Brewis Shoal)\nThe Motiti Protection Area containing Otaiti, Okarapu, Te Poroiti, Te Papa and other unnamed\nreefs is the largest of the three management areas designated by the Environment Court. This\nMotiti Protection Area covers 46.3km2 of the Bay of Plenty (Figure 4-1).\n4.1.1 Description\nOtaiti rises from a depth of around 70m and breaks the sea surface at mid to low tides. The reef\nhas a base circumference of about 1 km and covers an estimated 461,587m2 of seafloor. At high\ntide the reef is entirely submerged. Between mid and low tide, a small section of reef, with a\nsurface area somewhere in the range of 15 to 25m2, breaks the water\u2019s surface. Otaiti is located\napproximately 25km northeast of the entrance to Tauranga Harbour (Figure 1-1). Motiti Island is\napproximately 6.5km to the south and Tuhua (Mayor Island) is 30km to the north.\nOtaiti is comparable both in ecology and geology to a number of other Bay of Plenty reefs and\nislands. These include Okarapu Reef, Brewis Shoal, Motuhaka (Schooner Rocks), Tokoroa Shoal\nand Motunau (Plate Island) to the south, and Penguin Shoal, Tuhua Reef and Tuhua (Mayor\nIsland) to the north. All of these reefs are pinnacles of rock rising out of depths of between 40 and\n100m to either break the surface or come within 12m or less of doing so.\nThe distribution of biology is highly variable across the Otaiti reef, with the distribution of\norganisms largely determined by water depth and the characteristics of the reef\u2019s surface. The\nshallower and steeper sections of the reef are largely bedrock. In the deeper and less steep\nsections of reef, in addition to bedrock, there are boulder fields sitting atop the bedrock and some\nareas of sand and gravel. Below depths of approximately 40m, towards the base of the reef where\nthe gradient shelves off, the character of the seafloor changes to boulder fields, then cobbles,\nthen gravel then eventually to sand and the Bay of Plenty seafloor. Across these deeper\nboulder/cobble/gravel sections of reef there are also sections of bedrock reef which protrude from\nthe sea floor. These reefs can be seen on bathymetric charts of Otaiti, particularly to the north\nand east (Figure 4-2.)\n4.1.2 The Rena shipwreck and associated environmental knowledge\nAs a consequence of the Rena shipwreck, Otaiti is the most extensively studied subtidal reef in\nthe Bay of Plenty. While the bulk of the scientific work has focused on monitoring the distribution\nand fate of contaminants released from the Rena, a number of ecological studies have also been\nconducted. The majority of the following information in this section has been sourced (largely\nverbatim) with permission from the Rena Physical Environment Reference Report prepared as a\ncondition of BOPRC resource consent RC67891 (Ross at al. 2018).\nOn 5 October 2011, the container ship MV Rena grounded on Otaiti (Astrolabe Reef)\napproximately 25km northeast of the entrance to Tauranga Harbour causing the discharge of oil\nand the loss of debris and cargo overboard. Over the following days and months, the vessel\ncondition further deteriorated, broke apart and sank resulting in further significant losses of oil and\ncargo. The key impacted locations were Otaiti (the site where the Rena ran aground) and nearby\nMotiti Island, which was heavily affected by oil and debris immediately following the grounding.\nSalvage and recovery operations, including debris field clearance, were undertaken and ceased\non 1 April 2016.\nThere has been a large amount of scientific data collected at Motiti and Otaiti for the purposes of\nidentifying and quantifying effects of the Rena grounding on marine ecological values and for the\nassessment of the suitability of organisms for human consumption. Sampling has also been\nconducted periodically at control/reference locations: Tuhua (Mayor) Island and Rurimu Islands\n(located approximately 30km to the northwest and 50km to the southeast of Otaiti respectively).\n4.1.3 Reef habitat\nBroad scale habitat mapping has been undertaken to describe the distribution of major ecological\nhabitats across Otaiti based on recognised habitat classification schemes.\nThe most distinctive habitats at Otaiti and their approximate depth are listed in Table 4-1. Based\non the habitat map provided in Figure 3-1, it is possible to calculate the surface area and\npercentage of each habitat impacted in some way by the wreck. The biological habitats found to\nbe most impacted by the Rena, in terms of affected reef surface area, were as follows: kelp forest\n(2,741m2); kelp forest with sponge understory (2,843m2); and the kelp-sponge transition zone\n(3,420m2). When calculated by the proportion of a biological habitat that was impacted by the\nRena, the most affected habitats were: shallow mixed algae (14.5%); mixed algae (10.6%); and\nthe kelp forest with sponge understory habitat (10.1%) (Ross, 2016).\nTable 4-1: Spatial extent of reef habitats and the physical impacts of Rena wreckage and debris at Otaiti Reef. Calculations are based on\nthe 2015 bathymetric survey and 2016 predictive habitat map (Ross, 2016). Pre-Rena habitat estimates are derived from the depth\ndistribution of different habitat types and the surface area of reefs available at those depths.\nHabitat Zone Depth (m)\nPre-Rena\nhabitat\nextent\n(m2\n)\nArea\noccupied\nby wreck\n(m2\n)\nArea\nimpacted but\nnot occupied\nby wreck (m2\n)\nTotal area\nimpacted (m2\n)\nTotal habitat area not\noccupied by wreck\n(m2\n)\nShallow mixed algae 0-5 10,259 724 768 1,492 9,535\nMixed algae 5.1-10 18,087 489 1 421 1,910 17,598\nMixed algae/kelp 10.1-13 12,782 287 312 599 12,495\nKelp forest 13.1-25 73,043 1,703 1038 2,741 71,340\nKelp forest/ sponge 25.1-30 28,014 2,122 721 2,843 25,892\n\nHabitat Zone Depth (m)\nPre-Rena\nhabitat\nextent\n(m2\n)\nArea\noccupied\nby wreck\n(m2\n)\nArea\nimpacted but\nnot occupied\nby wreck (m2\n)\nTotal area\nimpacted (m2\n)\nTotal habitat area not\noccupied by wreck\n(m2\n)\nKelp/sponge\ntransition\n30.1-40 69,071 2,978 442 3,420 66,093\nDeep sponge reef\nboulders\n40.1-55 250,331 1,254 0 1,254 249,077\nTotal 461,586 9,557 4 702 14,259 452,030\n4.1.3.1 Otaiti reef habitat descriptions (P. M. Ross et al., 2018)\nThe shallow mixed algae habitat (depth range of 0-5m) is dominated by the macroalgae Lessonia\nvariegata and Carpophyllum flexuosum and plumosum. The subcanopy, which is the area\nunderneath the larger algal species, is fairly dense and is composed of foliose red and brown\nalgae including Xiphophora chondrophylla, Champia laingii, Chondracanthus chapmanii,\nHymenena sp. Pterocladia lucida, Vidalia colensoi, Codium sp., Colpomenia peregrine,\nCarpomitra costata, Dictyota sp., Halopteris sp., Microzonaria velutina, Zonaria aureomarginata\nand a variety of forms of coralline algae (crustose, articulated and pink paint). The shallow mixed\nalgae community is one that thrives in the highest of high energy environments that can be found\nin the Bay of Plenty. At Otaiti these organisms occur in the shallowest parts of the reef and are\nable to thrive despite experiencing the huge swells that caused the break-up of the Rena.\nThe mixed algae habitat (depth range of 5-10m) is dominated by Carpophyllum flexuosum. There\nis some Lessonia variegata present. The sub canopy is dense and is composed of the foliose red\nand brown algal species listed above.\nIn the mixed algae \u2013 kelp transition zone (10-13m), macroalgal stands are a mixture of\nCarpophyllum, Ecklonia radiata and some Lessonia variegata. The sub-canopy is composed of a\nmoderate to sparse cover of foliose red and brown algae.\nThe kelp forest habitat (13-25m), is more homogenous than the habitats found at shallower depths\nand is dominated by stands of large kelp Ecklonia radiata. On Otaiti, these plants can attain\nheights of more than 1.4m. The sub-canopy cover is sparse to moderate and mainly composed\nof Zonaria aureomarginata and crustose coralline algae.\nAcross the kelp forest depth range, there are also areas of barren rock where canopy-forming\nmacroalgae are absent and there is little in the way of subcanopy. These barren areas are\nsometimes created and maintained by sea urchins (Evechinus chloroticus) grazing down the kelp\nforest. In other barren areas, the mechanisms by which the reef is kept clear of macroalgae is\nuncertain as few urchins were observed at some barren areas during survey work. Other grazing\ngastropods, particularly Cookia sulcata were observed at relatively high densities in these barren\nareas but are unlikely to be responsible for reducing kelp cover. It is possible that these snails\ncould, through their grazing activity, maintain barren areas previously created by sea urchins.\nAcross a depth range of 25-30m, sponges, including Eciomenia alata (formerly Ancorina alata),\nTethya spp., Polymastia spp. and Cliona celata, appear more frequently in the understory of the\nEcklonia radiata forest. For the purposes of this report, this habitat has been named as the kelp\nforest with sponge understory zone.\nA kelp-sponge transition zone occurs across depths of 30-40m, where Ecklonia radiata becomes\nsparse and the reef is dominated by sponges of a variety of species, including those listed above.\nBeyond 40m, areas of bedrock are dominated by sponges as are boulder fields, mainly composed\nof small and large boulders (some cobbles) and dominated by encrusting sponges. This habitat\nis referred to, in this report, as the deep sponge reef\u2013boulder zone. Crustose coralline algae and\nturfing algae may also be present. Ecklonia radiata, although rare, still occur at these depths, an\nindication of the exceptional water clarity at this location.\n\nAcross the entire depth range, canopy forming macroalgae are largely absent from areas of reef\nthat are vertical, near vertical or overhung. The biological communities on these sections of reef\nare dominated by invertebrates, including sponges, ascidians, bryozoans, anemones,\nnudibranchs and hydroids.\n4.1.3.2 Predictive habitat map development\nA reef-wide predictive habitat map was developed in ArcGIS using the bathymetry from a multibeam survey conducted in 2015. The 2015 data were used as they provide greater coverage of\nOtaiti Reef than the 2014 survey and a more up to date picture of the distribution of Rena\nwreckage and debris.\nBased on the habitat by depth data and the probability of different habitats occurring at a given\ndepth, each 1m depth band was assigned to a specific habitat type. These habitats were then\nsuperimposed on the reef bathymetry to produce a predictive habitat map (Figure 4-3) (Ross,\n2016) (P. M. Ross et al., 2018).\nOn the habitat map, each colour represents the predicted distribution of a biological habitat.\nSurvey transects were then overlaid on this predictive habitat map and the habitat distributions\nmodified where necessary to reflect observations. This ground truthing process increased the\naccuracy of the map.\n\n\n\nRock wall and sloping reef communities\nRock wall and sloping reef communities were surveyed in 2015 (Figure 4-4) (Clark et al., 2016)\n\nRock Wall communities contained more epiphytic brown algae/diatoms, encrusting sponges,\nencrusting and turfing coralline algae and Ecklonia radiata, while the Sloping Reef communities\nwere typified by large brown algae (C. flexuosum, C. plumosum, X. chondrophylla, L. variegata),\nthe small brown alga Zonaria aureomarginata and the red alga P. lucida. Subtidal communities\nvaried with depth: shallower quadrats were characterised by large brown algae and the red alga\nP. lucida and deeper quadrats typified by E. radiata, encrusting and turfing coralline algae,\nfilamentous brown and red algae, encrusting sponges, Hymenena sp. and epiphytic brown\nalgae/diatoms.\nThe primary difference noted between the Sloping Reef and Rock Wall transects was the\ndominance of algal based habitats on the Sloping Reef transects. These included varying\nmixtures of the dominant macroalgal taxa including Lessonia variegata, Carpophyllum plumosum,\nC. flexuosum, Ecklonia radiata and Ulva sp. These large algal species are canopy forming and\nthus provide a protective understorey for encrusting algae, kina, sponges and grazing gastropods\n(e.g. turban snail - Cookia sulcata) and various small fish like triplefins (Forsterygion maryannae,\nNotoclinops segmentatus, etc.).\nIn contrast, the more vertical aspect of the rock wall, including overhangs and shade, the less\nlikely the attachment and growth of algal species. Therefore, the steeper habitats of the rock walls\ncan be very diverse: dominated by suspension feeding encrusting organisms, sessile solitary\nspecies like sponges, ascidians and anemones and a range of different mobile invertebrates\nincluding kina (Evechinus chloroticus), crayfish (Jasus edwardsii), nudibranchs (e.g. Jason\nmirabilis, Ceratosoma sp.), crabs, whelks (e.g. Charonia sp., Dicathais orbita), brittlestars, and\nseastars.\n\nReef survey\nIn 2016, surveys of Ecklonia radiata kelp forest and mixed algae habitats were undertaken of\nEastern Otaiti (Rena wreck affected) and Western Otaiti (non-existent/negligible Rena wreck\ninfluence) (P. M. Ross et al., 2018). Replicate 1m2 transects (n=18) were used as the sampling\nunit at each site. The following parameters were assessed in each quadrat:\na) Substratum type;\nb) Percent cover and dominant species of canopy forming algae;\nc) Percent cover and dominant species of sub-canopy algae;\nd) Canopy height;\ne) Ecklonia radiata stipe density;\nf) Sea urchin (Evechinus chloroticus) abundance;\ng) Herbivorous snail (Cookia sulcata) abundance;\nh) Abundance of other mobile species;\ni) Percent cover of encrusting sponges.\nWithin the kelp forest habitat, there was no significant difference between sites in relation to\ncanopy cover, canopy height, stipe density or abundance of Cookia sulcata. Sea urchin\n(Evechinus chloroticus) was found in higher abundance at the Western site. Kina barrens were\nnot apparent at the wreck site (Eastern) (P. M. Ross et al., 2018) (Grace, R, 2017). There were\nno significant differences in parameters measured in the mixed algae habitat between the\nWestern and Eastern sites.\nOther species present in the reef habitat include crayfish (Jasus edwardsii), paua (Haliotis iris),\npupu (Lunella smaragda), various limpets and predatory gastropods; Cabestana spengleri,\nCharonia lampas, Dicathais orbita and Haustrum haustorium (Ross, 2016; Akuhata, 2016; PaulBurke, 2016).\n4.1.4 Surrounding soft sediment habitat\nThe subtidal soft sediment benthic habitat surrounding Otaiti has not been surveyed for\ninvertebrate community composition (but see Section 4.1.7 below). However, gastropods were\ncollected from subtidal soft sediment habitats south-west of the reef (where higher tributyl-tin\nconcentrations in sediment have been detected) for imposex analysis2. Species detected\nincluded Ranella australasia, Sassia palmeri, Sassia parkinsoni, Penion cuvieranus, Murexsul\noctogonus, and Austrofusus glans. Imposex was detected in five of the seven female A. glans\ncollected.\n2 Imposex is the development of male genitalia in female snails, resulting in sterile organisms."
