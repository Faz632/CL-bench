We found that the behavior of\nthe resistivity as a function of temperature is in good agreement with the derived formula, especially when Tc is\nquite high and the phonon modes are dominated by optical phonons. Furthermore, we discovered that several\ncompounds in this class possess the so-called universal resistivity, which means that under a proper temperature\nscaling, the scaled resistivity behaves as a universal function, regardless of the types of the compounds. The free\nparameter in the model, \u03b8E, shows a strong correlation with the logarithmic average frequency, \u03c9ln. It can serve\nas a reasonable approximation of \u03c9ln, which can be compared directly with that from the celebrated Allen-Dynes\nformula. We showed the extracted data of several novel superhydride compounds, such as H3S, ThH9, ThH10,\nYD6, LaH10, and LaCeH20, LaBeH8, CaMgHx. We also compared our results with the available data from experiments and the density functional theory (DFT).\n1. Introduction\nIn 2004, Ashcroft suggested that hydride compounds could become a\nsuperconductor with a high value of Tc [1]. In 2015, H3S was observed\nin a high-pressure experiment by Eremets\u2019 group [2]. It was confirmed\nthat it is a conventional superconductor with Tc = 203 K at 155 GPa [2].\nThis discovery has opened the new era of the search for near-room\ntemperature superconductors in superhydride compounds. The word\n\u201csuperhydride\u201d is for MHx, where x > 2. We gave a few examples here.\nThe first one is ThHx compounds [3]. For example, ThH10 was confirmed\nby an experimental observation with Tc =159\u2013161 K between 170 and\n175 GPa [3]. The next one is LaH10, which is indeed a superconductor\nwith Tc = 260 K between 180 and 200 GPa [4], and a later report has\nconfirmed its superconductivity with Tc could be as high as 280 K [5].\nThe last one in our list is the YHx compounds, which were synthesized\nunder pressure [5\u20137]. The superconductivity of YH6 and YH9 compounds was confirmed with Tc = 227 K at 237 GPa and Tc = 243 K at\n201 GPa, respectively [7].\nThe superconductivity in binary hydride compounds have been\ninvestigated thoroughly for a full decade already. In the recent years, the\nattention has turned into ternary hydride compounds, i.e. AxByHz. There\nare large possibilities of how to combine atomic species, such as A, B and\nH. Nevertheless, some outstanding examples have already been theoretically investigated. One of the very first few examples is the theoretical prediction of MgCaH12 with Tc = 205\u2013288 K at 200 GPa [8], and\nfollowed by the experimental realization of MgCaHx [9]. Recently, there\nhave been some discoveries on LaCeH20 [10] and LaBeH8 [11], of which\nTc = 175 K at 155 GPa [10] and Tc = 110 K at 80 GPa [11], respectively.\nThe search for superconductivity in hydride compounds has been\nextended to lower dimension materials, such as several 2D ternary\ncompounds in the hydride compounds of Janus monolayer, such MoSH\n[12,13], TiSH [14], and WSH [15].\nAt T > Tc, the conventional superconductors undergo the phase\ntransition into a normal metal. In the metal phase, resistivity can be\nwell-described by Bloch-Gr\u00fcneisen (BG) formula [16] if the scattering\nprocess is dominated by electron-phonon interaction. The BG formula\ncan be written as\n\u03c1(T) = 4\u03c0m\nne2\n\u222b\nd\u03c9 \u03b2\u210f\u03c9\u03b12Ftr(\u03c9)\n(e\u03b2\u210f\u03c9 \u2212 1)(1 \u2212 e\u2212 \u03b2\u210f\u03c9)\n, (1)\nwhere \u03b12Ftr(\u03c9) is the transport Eliashberg spectral function, and\n\u03b2 \u2261 1/kBT.

In order to give the correct value of the\ntransport electron-phonon coupling, \u03bbtr, \u03b12Ftr(\u03c9) can be modified as\n\u03b12Ftr(\u03c9) = 2\u03bbtr\n\u03c94\n\u03c94\nD\n, (2)\nwhere 0 < \u03c9 < \u03c9D, and \u03c9D is Debye frequency. Consequently, the BG\nformula can be integrated analytically as\n\u03c1(T) = c\u03bbtr\n\u03b25\n\u222b \u03b2\u210f\u03c9D\n0\nd\u03b2\u210f\u03c9 (\u03b2\u210f\u03c9)\n5\n(e\u03b2\u210f\u03c9 \u2212 1)(1 \u2212 e\u2212 \u03b2\u210f\u03c9)\n, (3)\nwhere c is a corresponding constant. By changing variable z = \u03b2\u210f\u03c9, we\nobtained\n\u03c1(T) = c\u03bbtr\n\u03b25\n\u222b zD\n0\ndz z5\n(ez \u2212 1)(1 \u2212 e\u2212 z)\n, (4)\nwhere zD = \u03b2\u210f\u03c9D. This formula gives the low temperature limit as\n\u03c1(T)\u221dT5, and the high temperature limit as \u03c1(T)\u221d\u03bbtrT. In many cases,\n\u03b12Ftr(\u03c9) can be generalized to \u03c9n. In lower-dimension materials, such as\ngraphene [18,19], \u03b12Ftr(\u03c9) was shown to be proportional to \u03c93, and the\nlow temperature limit becomes \u03c1(T)\u221dT4 [18,19].\nRecently, the resistivity in the metal phase of a large number of superconductors has been analyzed in great detail, pioneered by Talantsev\n[20\u201325]. He discovered that superhydride compounds exhibit richness\nin physics. His elaborate works have inspired us to apply a similar\napproach to give a description of a special class of the superhydride\ncompounds in which the optical phonons are dominated. This is\nbecause, in all compounds, their optical phonons play important roles in\ntheir physical properties as well. Thus, in the next sections, we will\ninvestigate a simple model for the transport spectral function, \u03b12Ftr(\u03c9),\nin which the optical phonons are taken into the account. Then, the\ncorresponding temperature dependent resistivity can be derived.\nFinally, we will try to extract some important information from the\navailable experimental data, such as the Einstein temperature, \u03b8E, and\nthe logarithmic average frequency, \u03c9ln. We believe that we will gain\ninsight into the properties of the metallic and superconducting phases of\nseveral recently discovered conventional superconducting compounds.\n2. Methods\n2.1. Einstein model for transport spectral function\nIt is well-known that in all compounds with various atomic species,\nphonons can be divided into acoustic and optical phonons. There is a\ntendency that the optical phonons are the dominated phonons of the\nsystems. Thus, we would need a more appropriate model for accommodating the effects of the optical phonons. In order to describe superconductivity, Allen-Dynes [26] proposed Einstein model for\nEliashberg spectral function, \u03b12F(\u03c9) = \u03bb\u03c9\n2 \u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9E), where \u03c9E is Einstein frequency. If we modify this model for the transport property, a\nsimilar model can be derived as\n\u03b12Ftr(\u03c9) = \u03bbtr\u03c9\n2 \u03b4(\u03c9\u2212 \u03c9E), (5)\nwhere the subscript tr emphasizes on the transport property only. Thus,\n\u03bbtr is the transport electron-phonon coupling strength, and \u03b12Ftr(\u03c9) is the\ntransport Eliashberg spectral function. By inserting this model into the\nBG formula, Eq. (1), the temperature dependent resistivity can be\nwritten as\n\u03c1(T) = 4\u03c0m\nne2\n\u03bbtr\n2\n\u222b\nd\u03c9 \u03b2\u210f\u03c92\u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9E)\n(e\u03b2\u210f\u03c9 \u2212 1)(1 \u2212 e\u2212 \u03b2\u210f\u03c9)\n= 4\u03c0m\nne2\n\u03bbtr\n2\n\u03b2\u210f\u03c92\nE\n(e\u03b2\u210f\u03c9E \u2212 1)(1 \u2212 e\u2212 \u03b2\u210f\u03c9E )\n. (6)\nIf we use the transformation \u210f\u03c9E\nkB \u2192\u03b8E, which is the celebrated Einstein\ntemperature, the final form of the temperature dependent resistivity can\nbe written as\n\u03c1(T) = \u03c10 + A\n\u03b82\nE\nT \u239b\n\u239de\n\u03b8E\nT \u2212 1\n\u239e\n\u23a0\n\u239b\n\u239d1 \u2212 e\n\u2212 \u03b8E\nT\n\u239e\n\u23a0\n, (7)\nwhere, A is a corresponding constant. We have added \u03c10 for representing\nany residue resistivity from other possible modes of electron scattering.\nSometimes, it is more convenient to measure resistance, R, rather than\nresistivity, \u03c1, thus we can use the transformation, i.e. \u03c1\u2192R, \u03c10\u2192R0, and A\nwith a correctly corresponding unit. This formula has been used to\nanalyze the temperature dependent resistivity of La0.7Ca0.3-xKxMnO3\n[27].\nIn order to illustrate the capability of Eq. (7), the resistance of ThH9\n[3] is shown in Fig. 1 as an example. In this Figure, the extracted\nexperimental data are plotted as opened blue circles, whereas the fitted\nmodel, Eq. (7), is plotted as the full red line. We used a standard fitting\nprocedure, i.e. least squares fitting, to find the parameters R0, A and \u03b8E.\nIn this study, we performed similar fitting to the resistivity of various\nbinary compounds, such as ThH9 [3], ThH10 [3], YD6 [6], LaH10 [28],\nH3S [29], Th4H15 [30,31], SiH4 [32], ReBe22 [33], and ternary compounds, such as CaMgHx [9], LaCeH20 [10], LaBeH8 [11]. A pure metal,\nNb [34], is also investigated for comparison. The fitting results\n(Figure S1-S14), together with the fitting paramaters, \u03c10 (R0), A and \u03b8E,\nare summarized in Table S1 in supplementary.\n2.2. Universal resistivity\nIn order to simplify the formula, we can rearrange the BG formula,\nEq. (7), a little so that\nf(x) = x\n(ex \u2212 1)(1 \u2212 e\u2212 x)\n, (8.1)\nand also\nf(x) = \u03c1(T) \u2212 \u03c10\nA\u03b8E\n, (8.2)\nwhere x = \u03b8E/T. We discovered that f(x) in Eq. (8.1) is indeed a function\nof x only, regardless of any system-dependent parameter. This discovery\nallows us to construct the so-called universal resistivity from experimental measurements. The major aim of this work is to extract several\nFig. 1. shows the resistance of ThH9, extracted from experiment [3] (opened\nblue circles) and compared with the temperature dependent resistance derived\nfrom Einstein model, Eq.

This is\nbecause, in the conventional superconductors, the electron-phonon\ninteraction is very strong, and it could also dominate the resistivity in\nthe metal phase. The results will be presented in the next section.\n3. Results and discussion\nIn thissection, we performed graph fittings to extract the parameters,\nA, \u03c10 (or R0), and \u03b8E from the recently available experimental data by\nusing Eq. (7). We summarized Tc and \u03b8E in Table 1, and the other fitting\nresults are given in supplementary, Table S1 and Figure S1-S14.\nConsequently, we computed \u03c1(T)\u2212 \u03c10\nA\u03b8E (or R(T)\u2212 R0\nA\u03b8E ) and compared with f(x)\nusing Eq. (8.1). The typical results of various examples are shown in\nFig. 2. In order to take a large class of examples, we have extracted A, \u03c10\n(or R0), and \u03b8E, and computed f(x) for some famous binary compounds,\nsuch as ThH9 [3], ThH10 [3], YD6 [6], LaH10 [28], H3S [29], and recently\ndiscovered ternary compounds, such as CaMgHx [9], LaCeH20 [10],\nLaBeH8 [11]. This is to give a general survey and to find indicators for\nlimitations of the model.\nFrom Fig. 2, it is readily to see that the scaled resistivity or resistance\nof several compounds are in reasonable agreement with the universal\nfunction, Eq. (8.1). Nevertheless, there are some discrepancies. We\ndiscovered that, at very low temperature, i.e. T\n\u03b8E < 0.1, the universal\nfunction derived from Einstein model deviates significantly from the\nexperimental data points. The examples are the low-temperature resistance of Th4H15 [30,31], SiH4 [32], and ReBe22 [33], Nb [34]. The\ntemperature-dependent resistivity of ReBe22 [33] is shown in Fig. 3 as an\noutstanding example. The scaled resistivity of ReBe22 is in good agreement with the universal function, Eq. (8.1), where T\n\u03b8E > 0.1. However, for\nT\n\u03b8E < 0.1, the scaled resistivity deviates significantly from the universal\nfunction, see the inset of Fig. 3. Perhaps, the acoustic model must also be\ntaken into the account for these examples. This was already suggested in\nthe study of the resistivity of La0.7Ca0.3-xKxMnO3 [27]. In addition, our\nmodel is suitable for a special class of examples. However, in the latest\ndiscoveries, there are several superhydride compounds that exhibit\nrichness in physics, such as dR/dT < 0 in samples of La4H23 [35] or\nLa-Ce-H systems [36], or R(T) from a non-Fermi liquid in SnH4 [37].\nHence, a more elaborate model will be needed in order to accommodate\nthese behaviors. Some of these materials could be categorized into a new\nclass of unconventional superconductors.\nAt this stage, we would like to explore the possibility of our universal\nfunction for predicting the superconducting properties. It is readily seen\nTable 1\nshows various compounds with available measurement of Tc and the corresponding reported \u03bb. By assuming that all compounds have \u03bc\u2217 = 0.1, we can use\nEq. (9) to solve for \u03c9ln, compared with \u03b8E from data fitting to Eq. (7).

Next, if we\nuse Tc, \u03bb and Allen-Dynes equation [26,38], i.e.\nTc = \u03c9ln\n1.20 exp[\n\u2212 1.04(1 + \u03bb)\n\u03bb \u2212 \u03bc\u2217(1 + 0.62\u03bb)\n]\n, (9)\nto solve for \u03c9ln, its value will be independent from that of \u03b8E as well. The\nnumerical values of the logarithmic average frequency, \u03c9ln, and \u03b8E are\nshown in Table 1. The values of \u03bb from various references are also shown\nin Table 1. These \u03c9ln and \u03b8E are independently obtained data. Then, we\nplotted the data points (blue circles) of \u03c9ln vs \u03b8E, as shown in Fig. 4. The\nred line has slope equal to unity. We discovered that the blue circles are\nnot exactly on the red line, but the results show a very strong correlation\nbetween \u03c9ln and \u03b8E. This correlation can be improved if we allow \u03bc\u2217 to\nvary as well. It seems that, to some extent, \u03b8E could be a good approximation to \u03c9ln. The relation between \u03c9ln and \u03b8E has been studied in more\ndetail in a previous work [39]. Nevertheless, there is an exceptional\nexample, where the blue circle deviates largely from the red line. This\ndata comes from LaH10 [28,40], which has a high value of \u03bb. This finding\nsuggests that for a strong interaction, a more accurate equation, other\nthan Eq. (9), might also be needed to describe the electron-phonon\ninteraction correctly.\n4. Conclusion\nIn this work, we have suggested the use of the BG formula together\nwith Einstein model to give general description to the resistivity or\nresistance (Eq. (7)) of several compounds, which were discovered to be a\nconventional superconductor. The most significant discovery is that,\nwith proper temperature scaling, the scaled resistivity behaves as a\nuniversal function, f(x), Eq. (8.1). We showed that the resistivity or\nresistance of different types and structures of compounds, such as ThH9\n[3], ThH10 [3], YD6 [6], LaH10 [28], H3S [29], CaMgHx [9], LaCeH20\n[10], or LaBeH8 [11], behaves in this way. There is a possible discrepancy that if T\n\u03b8E < 0.1 or Tc is too low, we might need to consider the\ncontribution from the acoustic phonons as well. Furthermore, we\ndiscovered that \u03b8E has a strong correlation with \u03c9ln. Thus, we might be\nable to use this approximation \u03b8E \u2248 \u03c9ln as the first approximation. Our\nmodel can be used to analyze the results of future experiments on the\nresistivity of compounds, in which the optical phonon-electron\ninteraction is the dominated electron scattering mechanism.\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial\ninterests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence\nthe work reported in this paper.\nData Availability\nAll data are presented in this paper, and will be available upon\nrequest.\nAppendix A.

Recent research\non hydrogen-based superconductors (e.g., CaH6, LaH10, etc.) at high-pressure conditions lifts the record\nof superconducting critical temperature (Tc) up to ~250 kelvin. We here report the experimental synthesis\nof the first-ever room-temperature superconductor by compression on a mixture of La-Sc alloy and\nammonia borane at pressures of 250-260 gigapascals (GPa) via a diamond anvil cell by a laser-heating\ntechnique. Superconductivity with an onset temperature of 271-298 kelvin at 195-266 GPa is observed by\nthe measurement of zero electrical resistance and the suppression of Tc under applied magnetic fields.\nSynchrotron X-ray diffraction data unambiguously reveal that this superconductor crystallizes in a\nhexagonal structure with a stoichiometry LaSc2H24, in excellent agreement with our previous prediction1\n.\nThrough thirteen reproducible experimental runs, we provide solid evidence of the realization of a roomtemperature superconductor for the first time, marking a milestone in the field of superconductivity.\n2\nIntroduction\nSince the first discovery of superconductivity in mercury, scientists have devoted persistent efforts to\ndiscovering superconductors with higher superconducting critical temperatures (Tc). In 1985, Nobel laureate V.\nL. Ginzburg emphasized \u201chigh-temperature superconductivity\u201d as one of the most important and intriguing\nproblems in macrophysics2\n. Over the past decades, major advances have been achieved with the development\nof unconventional superconductors, including cuprates3-5\n, iron-based materials6,7\n, nickelate superconductors8-10\n,\nand especially conventional hydrogen-based superconductors that have pushed Tc to unprecedented levels (as\nhigh as 250 K)11-13\n. Nevertheless, the realization of room-temperature superconductivity remains a central goal\nand a major challenge in modern science.\nAlthough highly compressed hydrogen has long been proposed as a high-temperature superconductor\nowing to its lightest atomic mass and strong electron-phonon interactions14\n, direct experimental evidence for its\nmetallic phase remains elusive to date15,16\n. As alternatives, hydrogen-based compounds have emerged as\npromising candidates for high-temperature superconductivity at relatively lower pressures17,18\n. Progress in this\nfield was slow for decades, largely because the specific hydrides capable of high-Tc superconductivity had not\nyet been discovered, until the advent of crystal structure prediction methods transformed the landscape. The\n\u201cclathrate hydride\u201d paradigm was originally proposed for CaH6 in 2012 (ref. 19) and experimentally verified a\ndecade later, with superconductivity above 200 K (refs 20,21). In this structure, hydrogen transforms from bonding\nto antibonding states, resulting in a high density of states at the Fermi level and enhancement of electron-phonon\ncoupling. Building on this insight, a class of high-temperature superconducting rare-earth clathrate hydrides\nwere discovered, including LaH10 (refs\n11,12,22-25), YH9 (refs\n22,26,27), YH6 (refs\n22,26-29), and CeH9-10 (ref. 30), with\nLaH10 setting the Tc record (250 K at ~180 GPa)11,12\n. Other binary hydrides, such as covalent H-S compounds\nwith Tc up to 203 K (refs 13,31-34), have also been extensively explored35\n.\n3\nCompared with binary hydrides, ternary hydrides have attracted growing interest owing to their greater\nelemental diversity and structural complexity36-38, which may open new avenues toward room-temperature\nsuperconductivity36,39\n. For instance, metastable Li2MgH16 has been predicted to exhibit \u201chot\u201d superconductivity\nwith Tc of 351-473 K under multimegabar pressure40\n. In addition, several other high-Tc hydrides, including\nMBxHy (refs 41-43), MBeH8 (refs.\n44,45), and Mg2IrH6-7 (refs\n46-48), have been calculated to be stable under\ncomparatively lower pressures. Experimentally, progresses have been achieved by incorporating a third element\ninto the La-H system, giving rise to two types of superconducting ternary hydrides. The first involves doping\nbinary hydride to form non-stoichiometric alloy superhydrides (e.g. (La,Y)H6, (La,Y)H10 (ref. 49), (La,Ce)H9-10\n(refs\n50,51), (La,Nd)H10 (ref.\n52), and (La,Ca)H10 (ref.\n53)), where dopant atoms randomly substitute the metal\npositions or occupy interstitial sites within the parent binary hydrides. This strategy, however, introduces no\nnew structure and has yielded only limited improvements in superconductivity51-53. The second pathway\ninvolves the formation of entirely new ternary structural prototypes, such as recently synthesized LaBeH8 and\nLaB2H8 (refs\n54,55), featuring a La-based framework integrated with XHn units within the La sublattice. Although\ntheir Tcs do not surpass those of certain binary hydrides, these compounds demonstrate the feasibility of\ndesigning and synthesizing ternary hydrides with diverse structural motifs capable of supporting hightemperature superconductivity.\nVery recently, our theoretical study employing the crystal structure prediction (CALYPSO) method\nproposed a ternary high-Tc superhydride, LaSc2H24 (ref. 1\n), featuring hexagonal P6/mmm symmetry. The\nintroduction of Sc, which shares a similar valence electron configuration as La but possesses a lighter mass and\na smaller atomic radius, resulted in the formation of two previously unreported hydrogen cages: H24 surrounding\nSc and H30 surrounding La. These two novel hydrogen frameworks were predicted to produce an exceptionally\nlarge hydrogen-derived density of states at the Fermi level, giving rise to an exceptionally high Tc of up to 316\n4\nK at high pressure. Crucially, LaSc2H24 is thermodynamically stable across experimentally accessible pressures,\nbringing the prospect of room-temperature superconductivity closer than ever before.\nInspired by the above prediction1\n, we synthesized a ternary clathrate La-Sc alloy hydride and investigated\nits superconducting properties under high pressure. In-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments revealed that\nthe compound crystallizes in a hexagonal structure, in excellent agreement with the predicted P6/mmm LaSc2H24\nstructure, and remains stable down to 194 GPa. Superconductivity, with a maximum onset temperature (Tc\nonset)\nof 298 K, was confirmed by both the observation of zero electrical resistance and the suppression of Tc under\napplied magnetic fields. These results announce the realization of a room-temperature superconductor and may\nherald the emergence of superconductors with even higher Tc.\nResults\nSynthesis of the ternary La-Sc-H compound\nBased on the theoretically predicted stoichiometry, a homogeneous La-Sc alloy with an elemental ratio of\n~1:2 (Extended Data Table 1) and NH3BH3, a common hydrogen source in high-pressure hydride synthesis\n11,20,26,30,50,54\n, were used as precursors. High pressure was generated using a diamond anvil cell (DAC), and laser\nheating provided the thermal energy necessary to overcome the reaction barrier. After irradiation, the samples\nturned black (Fig. 1 (b) and Extended Data Fig. 1) and exhibited a pressure drop, suggesting that the intended\nchemical reaction had occurred, accompanied by a probable volume collapse.\nSince the target compound LaSc2H24 has been calculated to be thermodynamically stable at pressure as low\nas 167 GPa (ref. 1\n), initial synthesis attempts were carried out below 200 GPa. The samples were pressurized at\nroom temperature and subsequently heated for one minute. Although some products were non-superconducting,\nsuperconducting transitions with onset temperatures around 250 K (Extended Data Fig. 2) were observed in\nthree experimental runs at 183-195 GPa. These were attributed either to binary LaH10 (refs\n11,12,56) or an\n5\nunidentified ternary La-Sc-H phase, neither of which showed a significant enhancement in Tc, suggesting that\nthe target LaSc2H24 had not yet formed. Approximately ten further attempts to synthesize LaSc2H24 between 200\nand 250 GPa also did not yield higher Tc. Consequently, the synthesis pressure was increased to ~260 GPa,\nwhere formation of LaSc2H24 is more favorable, as calculations indicate improved energetic stability relative to\ndecomposition products1\n. At this pressure, we observed a pronounced enhancement of superconductivity, with\nTc significantly exceeding the ~250 K reported in LaH10, although whether the La-Sc-H compound with high Tc\ncan be synthesized at lower pressure remains an open question.\nSuperconducting temperature of the La-Sc-H compound\nWe first reproduced the superconductivity in binary La-H system at 170 GPa, observing a Tc of 248 K with\na clear transition to zero resistance (Extended Data Fig. 2), in excellent agreement with previous report on LaH10\n(ref.\n12\n). This validates the reliability of our cryogenic system and electrical transport measurement. We then\nprobe the superconductivity of the synthesized La\u2013Sc\u2013H compound near 250 GPa. Representative resistancetemperature curves from independent runs in cells 1, 3, 4, and 5 are shown in Figure 2(a). Abrupt resistance\ndrops were observed at 295 K (245 GPa), 283 K (253 GPa), 298 K (260 GPa), and 295 K (262 GPa) in cells 1,\n3, 4, and 5, respectively, signaling the onset of the superconducting transitions. Notably, the \u201czero resistance\u201d,\ncharacterized by oscillations around zero, was detected in cells 4 and 5 (insert of Fig. 2(a)), thereby ruling out\na temperature-induced phase transition and providing one of the compelling evidence of superconductivity.\nBesides, superconductivity with lower Tcs values of 272 K at 256 GPa and 271 K at 260 GPa was observed in\ncells 4\n*\nand 5*\n(Extended Data Figs. 7 and 8). Furthermore, in all electrical transport experiments, we confirmed\nthat all four electrodes remained conductive, eliminating the possibility of a short producing the \u201cfalse zero\nresistance\u201d phenomenon postulated by Hirsch57\n.\nGiven the considerable scientific significance and interest of determining whether pressure can tune or\n6\nenhance Tc, the pressure dependence of Tc\nonset is investigated as shown in Fig. 2(b). In cells 1 and 3, the Tc\nonsets\ndecrease with increasing pressure, from 295 K (245 GPa) to 289 K (254 GPa), and from 283 K (253 GPa) to\n281 K (257 GPa), respectively. In cells 4 and 5, Tc\nonsets consistently exceeds 290 K and shows no clear pressure\ndependence within the range of 195-266 GPa. At 195 GPa, the exhibits anomalous behavior, including an\nabnormal jump during the superconducting transition and an unphysical negative resistance between 230 and\n277 K, rather than fluctuating near zero (Extended Data Fig. 5(a)). These features suggest a circuit abnormality,\nlikely caused by partial decomposition of this superconducting phase at this pressure.\nIt is worth noting that Tc\nonset varies among different cells at the same pressures. This variation may arise\nfrom sample inhomogeneity, such as a slight difference in hydrogen concentration during synthesis and pressure\ngradients under ultrahigh pressures, as commonly observed in other reported high-Tc hydrides\n12,30,54\n.\nFurthermore, recent work on diffusion-driven transient hydrogenation in metal superhydrides under extreme\nconditions has demonstrated dynamic de-hydrogenation and gradual decomposition over several days, which\ncan also affect the Tc\n58\n. These considerations suggest that, upon decompression, factors beyond pressure may\ninfluence the Tc of this hydride. Despite such variations, the observed Tc values represent the highest reported\nto date and are consistent with our previous theoretical prediction of 296 K at 250 GPa based on anharmonic\napproximation1\n, which significantly impacts dynamic stability, phonon frequencies, and superconductivity25,33,34\n.\nSuppression of superconductivity under external magnetic fields\nThe Meissner effect, which describes the expulsion of magnetic flux from a superconductor, serves as key\nevidence for superconductivity alongside zero resistance. Recent advancesin magnetic measurement techniques\nhave enabled detection of this effect even within diamond anvil cells\n59\n. However, in ultra-high-pressure\nexperiments, the minute sample size (~10-20 \u03bcm) produces very weak signals, restricting magnetic\nmeasurements. Nevertheless, superconductivity can be verified by the suppression of Tc under applied external\n7\nmagnetic fields, a method commonly employed in high-pressure superconducting hydride studies\n12,20,30,54,60\n. Tc\ndecreases progressively with increasing fields due to the breaking of Cooper pairs via orbital and spinparamagnetic effects. As shown in Fig. 3(a), Tc decreased by about 11 K, from 296 K to 285 K under a magnetic\nfield (\u03bc0H) of 0-9 T at 219 GPa in cell 4. Importantly, this suppression was consistently reproduced in other\ndifferent cells 3, 4*\n, and 5 (Extended Data Figs. 8, 9, and 10), strongly confirming the superconducting nature\nof the synthesized La-Sc-H compound.\nTo estimate the upper critical magnetic field (\u03bc0Hc2(T)), we extrapolated two sets of Tc values, defined as\nthe temperature at which the resistance drops to 90% and 50% of the normal-state value at 219 GPa. The\nextrapolated \u03bc0Hc2(0) ranges are 89-114 T using the Ginzburg-Landau (GL)61,62 model, 122-156 T using the\nWerthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH)63 model, and 177-228 T using a linear fitting commonly applied in\ncompressed superhydrides64,65. The GL coherence length, derived from Hc2(0), is 1.70-1.92 nm, indicating that\nthe synthesized superconducting hydride is a typical type-II superconductor.\nCrystal structure of the synthesized La-Sc-H compounds\nTo elucidate the crystal structure of the synthetic La-Sc-H products and gain insights into the mechanism\nof room-temperature superconductivity, we performed in-situ XRD measurements in cells 1, 2, and 5. Notably,\nhigh-temperature superconducting transitions of 289-295 K were observed in cells 1 and 5 (Extended Data Figs.\n3 and 6). As shown in Fig. 4(a), at 254 GPa, four peaks at 8.44\n\u00b0\n, 13.56\u00b0\n, 14.64\u00b0\n, and 20.01\n\u00b0\nin cell 1 can be\nindexed by a hexagonal close-packed (hcp) lattice with cell parameters of a = 4.86(4) \u00c5 and c = 3.35(6) \u00c5,\nwhich correspond well with the theoretical P6/mmm structure of stoichiometric LaSc2H24 (a = 4.831 \u00c5 and c =\n3.341 \u00c5 at 250 GPa) (ref. 1\n). These peaks correspond to the (1 0 0), (1 0 1), (1 1 0), and (2 0 1) planes, respectively.\nTwo additional weak peaks at 16.92\u00b0\nand 18.11\n\u00b0\nassigned to the (2 0 0) and (1 1 1) planes are consistent with the\ncalculated XRD pattern (Fig. 4(a)), but were not apparent in the structural refinement. Their presence, however,\n8\ncan be discerned in the raw pattern (Extended Data Fig. 12), further confirming that the synthesized compound\npossesses hcp symmetry. Moreover, the LaSc2H24 phase was excellently identified from 13 diffraction peaks in\nanother independent cell 5 (Extended Data Fig. 14), where superconductivity with Tc above 290 K was verified.\nThe experimentally refined cell parameters (a = 4.85(9) \u00c5 and c = 3.35(5) \u00c5) and volume are perfectly consistent\nwith the simulation values, indicating the reliability and reproducibility of the high-Tc phase.\nTo assess the structural stability of this synthesized hcp LaSc2H24, decompression XRD was carried out in\ncell 2. As shown in Extended Data Fig. 13, diffraction peaks corresponding to the P6/mmm structure were\nidentified at 266 GPa and gradually shifted to lower angles as the pressure decreased to 194 GPa. Below 194\nGPa, the (1 0 0) and (1 1 0) peaks began to split, and the intensity of (1 0 1) peak gradually decreased, indicating\nthe onset of lattice instability or the partial decomposition, consistent with the abnormal superconducting\nbehavior observed at 195 GPa in electrical measurements. Using the refined crystal structure parameters at each\npressure, we constructed the equation of state (EOS) for the synthesized LaSc2H24 (Fig. 4(b)). Experimental\nEOS data from cell 2 follow a continuous curve without noticeable discontinuities, indicating good stability and\nreproducibility across the pressure range. Notably, the experimental EOS is consistent with, but slightly higher\nthan, the theoretical curve of the P6/mmm LaSc2H24 (Ref. 1\n), which may reflect a typical difference between\nexperiment and theory or a slight deviation in the hydrogen content from the ideal stoichiometry, a phenomenon\ncommonly observed in other compressed hydrides24,51,65\n. In addition, a recent experimental work claimed a\nsynthesis of LaSc alloy hydride with an equimolar metal ratio at ~190 GPa, exhibiting a resistance drop at 274\nK66. This phase was proposed to adopt a substituted-type hexagonal (La,Sc)H6-7, with a diffraction pattern\ndistinct from that observed in this work (Extended Data Fig. 15).\nDiscussion\nHydrogen in high-Tc LaSc2H24\n9\nFigure 5 shows the crystal structure of the P6/mmm-structured LaSc2H24, where La and Sc atoms occupy\nlattice sites of an MgB2-type structure and are each surrounded by H30 cages and H24 cages, both of which are\nnot observed in known clathrate or zeolite networks. While the diffraction peaks can be well refined with the\nLaSc2H24 structure, they primarily reveal the positions of the metal sublattice. Due to the limited flux of current\nX-ray sources, resolving the exact positions of light H atoms remains challenging, an inherent limitation of\nXRD-based structure determination of superhydrides under ultrahigh pressures. Nevertheless, the hydrogen\nconcentration can be estimated from lattice volume expansion caused by hydrogen, a method previously applied\nto other polyhydrides12,20,26,30,50,54\n. Although the atomic volumes of La, Sc, and H atoms in the ternary compound\nare not directly known, they can be inferred from their high-pressure elemental phases67-69\n. Taking an example,\nat 254 GPa, the refined volume (Vlattice) of synthesized La-Sc-H compound is 68.788 \u00c53\n/f.u., and the estimated\natomic volumes VLa, VSc, and VH are ~12.990, ~8.196, and ~1.620 \u00c53\n/atom, respectively. Based on these values,\nthe hydrogen contents (n) is calculated as n = (Vlattice - VLa - 2VSc)/VH = 24.3, almost close to the ideal value of\n24.\nWe also observed probable de-hydrogenation of the synthesized LaSc2H24+x (x~-1.1\uf02d1.4) during\ndecompression, a behavior similar to that reported in other superconducting hydrides such as LaH10\u00b1x (refs 12,24),\nwhere the experimentally estimated hydrogen content often deviates from the ideal stoichiometry and varies\nacross different cells and pressures. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the experimental EOS curve intersects the dashed\ncurve representing the unreacted elemental assemblage at ~250 GPa, suggesting hydrogen loss upon\ndecompression. The estimated hydrogen contents decrease from 25.4 at 266 GPa to 22.9 at 194 GPa,\ncorresponding to x = -1.1 to +1.4 in LaSc2H24+x and a deduced de-hydrogenation rate of -0.03 atom/GPa\n(Extended Data Table 3). Nevertheless, direct characterization of hydrogen remains limited, and relevant highpressure techniques are still developing. Emerging methods such as high-pressure nuclear magnetic resonance70\n10\nmay provide further insights into hydrogen in the crystal structure of LaSc2H24 and its role in facilitating hightemperature superconductivity.\nSignificant role of Sc in high-Tc LaSc2H24\nFinally, we discuss the underlying mechanism behind room-temperature superconductivity in LaSc2H24.\nAmong rare earth elements, Sc is unique in the La-X-H ternary superhydride family due to its lightest atomic\nmass, smallest atomic radius, and a valence electronic configuration (4s\n23d\n1\n) similar to that of La (6s\n25d\n1\n). A\nlighter atomic mass is known to favor higher Tc in conventional superconductors. Moreover, the atomic radius\nratio of La to Sc is estimated to be about 1.17 at 254 GPa, surpassing the 15% limit specified by the HumeRothery rule71\n. In contrast, previous ternary superhydrides such as La-Ce-H50,51 and La-Y-H49,60\n, exhibit the\nminimal atomic size mismatch (e.g., La/Ce~1.03 (ref. 50)), leading to a disordered solid solution where the two\nmetals randomly occupy equivalent sublattice positions, leaving the hydrogen clathrate framework largely\nunaltered. In the present work, introduction of Sc into the La-H binary system under high pressure yields a\nfundamentally different outcome: a nested, composite structure. La and Sc occupy distinct MgB2-type lattice\nsites, stabilizing two previously unreported H30 and H24 cages. These unique hydrogen frameworks form a\nweakly covalent, nonmolecular hydrogen network, directly enhancing the Fermi-level density of states at the\nand electron-phonon coupling. Moreover, Sc lacks localized f electrons, unlike Ce or Nd, thereby avoiding the\nmagnetic scattering that can suppress s-wave superconductivity50,52\n. Collectively, these analyses highlight the\ncrucial role of Sc in stabilizing novel hydrogen clathrates and enabling room-temperature superconductivity in\nLaSc2H24, with a dramatic Tc enhancement compared to LaH10. This insight naturally points to an exciting future\ndirection: doping the La-Sc-H system with other appropriate elements, guided by the advanced crystal structure\nprediction method, may further enhance Tc.\nWith the development of high-pressure characterization techniques, extensive research remains to reveal\n11\nthe enigma surrounding this room-temperature superconductor. For instance, the isotope substitution of\nhydrogen with deuterium could verify its conventional superconductivity. Recently, diamagnetism associated\nwith the Meissner effect was successfully detected in CeH9 up to about 140 GPa using nitrogen-vacancy\nquantum sensors implanted directly within anvil72\n. Extending such measurements above 200 GPa could enable\ndirect magnetic characterization of room-temperature superconducting LaSc2H24. In addition, advanced ultrahigh-pressure tunneling spectroscopy may uncover the superconducting gap, providing insight into its\nsuperconducting nature73\n. Nevertheless, the successful experimental synthesis and characterization of LaSc2H24\nare shining through the starry sky of mankind\u2019s ongoing efforts to explore high-temperature superconductors\nand are greatly encouraging for the exploration of wide-ranging multinary superhydrides that might exhibit\nhigher Tc even under moderate pressures.\nConclusions\nIn summary, we synthesized the room-temperature superconducting La-Sc alloy hydride under high\npressure. Superconductivity with a maximum Tc of 298 K was convincingly confirmed by both the zero\nresistance and the suppression of Tc under external magnetic fields. XRD measurements indicate that the alloy\nhydride matches up well with the stoichiometric LaSc2H24 and remains metastable above ~194 GPa at room\ntemperature. Our findings constitute a significant advance in condensed matter physics, demonstrating the roomtemperature superconductor with a resolved crystal structure and a clearly identified superconducting\nmechanism, while highlighting the tremendous potential of multinary superhydrides for realizing hightemperature superconductors.\n12\nMethods\nAlloy precursor preparation\nThe precursor La-Sc alloy was prepared either by melting or double target co-magnetron sputtering. In the\nmelting method, La and Sc (in a molar ratio of ~1:2) with a purity of 99.9% were thoroughly heated and melted\nin an Ar atmosphere. To ensure compositional uniformity, the ingot was turned over and remelted multiple times.\nFor magnetron sputtering, La and Sc metals were co-sputtered onto a glass substrate, with both targets presputtered to remove surface oxides. The ~1:2 molar ratio and compositional homogeneity of La-Sc alloys were\nconfirmed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (Thermo Fisher iCAP PRO) and\nscanning electron microscope (JEM-2000FS, Regulus 8100, and ZEISS Gemini 300) equipped for the energy\ndispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Corresponding EDS results are summarized in Extended Data Table. 1.\nHydride synthesis under high pressure\nLa-Sc alloy hydride was synthesized via the reaction of La-Sc alloy with NH3BH3 (Sigma-Aldrich, 97%)\nin a diamond anvil cell (DAC). The diamond anvils had culets with diameter of 30 \u03bcm, beveled at 8.5\u00b0\nto a\ndiameter of about 250 \u03bcm. An insulating composite gasket was prepared following a procedure similar to that\nreported previously13\n. Briefly, a rhenium gasket (thickness of 250 \u03bcm) was precompressed to about 20 GPa to\nmake an indent, from which a ~50 \u03bcm diameter cavity was drilled. The cavity was filled with an epoxy-alumina\npowder composite and compressed to a thickness of 10-15 \u03bcm between the anvil and rhenium gasket. Finally, a\nhole (diameter of 10-15 \u03bcm) was drilled to clamp the sample. A La-Sc alloy foil (~1-2 \u03bcm thickness, ~15 \u03bcm\ndiameter) was then sandwiched between layers of NH3BH3.\nSample preparation and loading were carried out inside an Ar-filled glove box, with the residual oxygen\nand water levels below 0.01 ppm, ensuring the sample was properly protected from oxidation and moisture. The\nprecursors were then compressed to the target pressure at room temperature. Pressures were determined from\nthe room-temperature first-order diamond Raman edge calibrated by Akahama74 75\n. Two-sided laser-heating\nexperiments were performed using a pulsed YAG laser (1064 nm) with a spot size of ~10 \u03bcm in diameter.\nSynchrotron X-ray diffraction measurements\nIn-suit X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected at Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF)\nBeamlines BL15U1 (\u03bb=0.6199 \u00c5) and BL11ID (0.4169 \u00c5) using focused monochromatic X-ray beams with\nspot sizes around 4\u00d75 and 2\u00d73 \u03bcm2\n, respectively. Angle-dispersive XRD data were recorded with a Mar165\nCCD detector (BL15U1) and a Pilatus CdTe 2M detector (BL11ID). The sample-to-detector distance and other\n13\ngeometric parameters were calibrated using a CeO2 standard. Powder diffraction rings were integrated and\nconverted to one-dimensional profiles using the software package Dioptas76\n. Full profile analysis and Rietveld\nrefinements were done using GSAS-II and EXPGUI packages77\n.\nElectrical transport measurements\nResistances were measured via the four-probe van der Pauw method to eliminate contributions from\nsources other than the samples, with currents of 0.1-5 mA. Four hand-ranged Pt electrodes with a thickness of\n~2 \u03bcm were placed in direct contact with the sample at the center of the culet. Pt foils attached to the anvil\nsidewall were connected to the electrodes, and enameled copper wire extended the connections to external\nequipment. Electronic transport measurements under external magnetic fields of cells 3, 4, and 5 were carried\nout using two Cryomagnetics\u2019C-Mag Cryogen-FREE magnet systems capable of generating fields up to 12 T\nand 9 T. Due to a temperature gradient between the temperature sensor and the sample, the cooling and warming\ncycles differed20; onset temperatures of the resistance drops were recorded upon warming for comparisons with\nthe other superconducting hydrides, with a slow heating ratio of 1-3 K/min and intervals of 0.1-0.5 K. Chamber\npressures typically increased after the cooling cycle, the post-cooling pressure was used to represent the entire\nprocess.\n14\nData availability\nThe authors declare that the main data supporting the findings of this study are contained within the paper\nand its associated Supplementary Information.
