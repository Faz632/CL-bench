The species is named after Richard M. Kemp, a fisherman from Key West, Florida, who first submitted the species for identification in 1906. They are primarily found in the Gulf of America (formerly Gulf of Mexico), but juveniles are also found in the Atlantic Ocean as far north as Nova Scotia and sometimes even occur in the eastern North Atlantic Ocean.\n\nKemp\u2019s ridleys were once abundant in the Gulf of America with tens of thousands of females nesting at Rancho Nuevo, Mexico. The population crashed in the mid-20th century to a low of only several hundred females nesting (representing fewer than 250 nests) in the 1980s. Intensive conservation actions were implemented on nesting beaches and through fisheries management. Bycatch in commercial and recreational fishing gear continues to be the biggest threat facing Kemp\u2019s ridley sea turtles. \n\nNOAA Fisheries and our partners are dedicated to protecting and recovering the Kemp\u2019s ridley sea turtle. We use a variety of innovative techniques to study, protect, and recover this endangered species. We engage our partners as we develop measures and implement recovery plans that foster the conservation and recovery of Kemp\u2019s ridleys and their habitats, and we fund research, monitoring, and conservation projects to implement priorities outlined in recovery plans.\n\nPopulation Status\nThe Kemp\u2019s ridley turtle is listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act. Prior to the mid-20th century, the Kemp's ridley was abundant in the Gulf of America. An amateur video from 1947 documented tens of thousands of Kemp\u2019s ridleys nesting near Rancho Nuevo, Mexico on a single day. This nesting population experienced a devastating decline between the late 1940s and the mid-1980s. The number of nests reached a record low of 702 in 1985, representing fewer than 250 nesting females. Due to intensive conservation actions, the Kemp's ridley began to slowly rebound during the 1990s. The number of nests increased about 15 percent each year through 2009. However, in 2010 this rapid increase abruptly ended and the number of nests has fluctuated since then. The unexpected change in Kemp\u2019s ridley nesting highlights the importance of continued protection, monitoring, and conservation efforts. \n\nThe majority of Kemp\u2019s ridley nesting occurs on the beaches of the western Gulf and ninety-five percent of worldwide Kemp\u2019s ridley nesting occurs in the state of Tamaulipas, Mexico. The three main nesting beaches in Tamaulipas are Rancho Nuevo, Tepehuajes, and Barra del Tordo. Nesting also occurs in Veracruz, Mexico, and in Texas, but on a much smaller scale. Occasional nesting has been documented in North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, and Alabama. \n\nThe 2015 ESA 5-year review of the Kemp's ridley sea turtle provides additional information on abundance and population trends.\n\nAppearance\nThe Kemp's ridley turtle has a triangular-shaped head with a slightly hooked beak. Hatchlings are darkly colored on both sides. Adults are generally a grayish-green color on top with a pale, yellowish bottom shell. The top shell (carapace) is often as wide as it is long. Each of the front flippers has one claw while the back flippers may have one or two.\n\nBehavior and Diet\nKemp\u2019s ridley turtles, like all sea turtles, are marine reptiles and must come to the surface to breathe. Adult female sea turtles return to land to lay their eggs in the sand\u2014they are remarkable navigators and usually return to a beach in the general area where they hatched decades earlier.\n\nThe Kemp's ridley is one of two species of sea turtles that engage in \"arribada\" nesting, where large groups of females gather offshore and come onto the beach to nest all at once. Nesting in large groups may be a defense against predators, or a result of environmental factors influencing nesting. With many turtles coming ashore together and many nests subsequently hatching at the same time, the large numbers of hatchlings entering the ocean may help to overwhelm predators and ensure that more hatchlings survive. The other species of sea turtle that nests en masse is the olive ridley. The Kemp\u2019s ridley is the only species of sea turtle that routinely nests during the day. \n\nAfter emerging from the nest, hatchlings enter the water and swim rapidly offshore. Some hatchlings remain in currents within the Gulf of America while others may be swept out of the Gulf, around Florida, and into the Atlantic Ocean by the Gulf Stream. Juvenile Kemp\u2019s ridleys associate with floating Sargassum algae, using the Sargassum as an area of refuge, rest, and a place to feed on small animals and plants. This developmental drifting period lasts 1 to 2 years or until the turtle reaches a length of about 8 inches. After this oceanic phase, Kemp\u2019s ridleys migrate to nearshore areas of the Gulf of America or northwestern Atlantic Ocean. After recruiting to shallow coastal areas, crabs are their preferred food.\n\nDepending on their breeding strategy, male Kemp's ridleys occupy many different areas within the Gulf of America. Some males migrate annually between feeding and breeding grounds, yet others may not migrate at all, mating with females encountered at their feeding grounds or near nesting beaches. Female Kemp's ridleys have been tracked migrating to and from nesting beaches in Mexico and south Texas. Females leave breeding and nesting areas and migrate to foraging areas ranging from the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula to southern Florida to the north-central Gulf of America. Some females take up residence in specific foraging grounds for months at a time and return to the same foraging grounds in subsequent years.\n\nWhere They Live\nKemp's ridleys are distributed throughout the Gulf of America and U.S. Atlantic seaboard, from Florida to New England. A few records exist for Kemp's ridleys in Canada, near the Azores, the United Kingdom, waters off Morocco, and within the Mediterranean Sea and they are occasionally found in other areas around the Atlantic Basin. Adult Kemp's ridleys primarily occupy nearshore coastal (neritic) habitats in the Gulf of America that include muddy or sandy bottoms where their preferred prey are found.\n\nKemp_s Ridley Turtle Range.png\nWorld map providing approximate representation of the Kemp's ridley turtle's range.\nLifespan & Reproduction\nNo one knows exactly how long Kemp\u2019s ridleys live, but like other sea turtles, they are likely long-lived, reaching maturity at about 13 years of age and have an estimated lifespan of at least 30 years.\n\nKemp's ridleys display one of the most unique synchronized nesting habits in the natural world. Adult female Kemp's ridleys gather off nesting beaches in northeastern Mexico and come ashore in large groups, called arribadas, which means \"arrival\" in Spanish. There are many theories on what triggers an arribada, including offshore winds, lunar cycles, and the release of pheromones by females. However, scientists have yet to conclusively determine what triggers an arribada. Arribada nesting is a behavior found only in the genus Lepidochelys which includes the olive ridley sea turtle (Lepidochelys olivacea) and Kemp\u2019s ridley.\n\nNesting occurs from April to July and unlike the other species which nest at night, Kemp\u2019s ridleys nest during daylight hours. They lay an average of 2 to 3 clutches per season, and return to the beach to nest every 1 to 3 years. The females dig an egg chamber in the sand where they lay approximately 100 eggs, which incubate for 50 to 60 days. Hatchlings orient seaward by moving away from the darkest silhouette of the landward dune or vegetation to crawl towards the brightest horizon. On undeveloped beaches, this is toward the open horizon over the ocean.\n\nThreats\nBycatch in Fishing Gear\nA primary threat to sea turtles is their unintended capture in fishing gear which can result in drowning or cause injuries that lead to death or debilitation (for example, swallowing hooks, or flipper entanglement). The term for this unintended capture is bycatch. Sea turtle bycatch is a worldwide problem. Kemp\u2019s ridleys are primarily caught in trawls, gillnets, longlines, hook and lines, pot/traps, and dredges in the Gulf of America and northwest Atlantic.\n\nDirect Harvest of Turtles and Eggs\nAlmost the entire Kemp\u2019s ridley sea turtle population nests on the beaches of the western Gulf, primarily in Tamaulipas, Mexico, just south of the United States-Mexico border. The arribada nesting behavior concentrates females and nests at the same time and in the same place, enabling the taking of an extraordinary number of eggs for human consumption. Historically, egg collection for human consumption was a significant problem in this area, but this threat has been diminished by the protection of nests and turtles in both Mexico and the United States. \n\nLoss and Degradation of Nesting Habitat\nCoastal development and rising seas are leading to the loss of nesting beach habitat for sea turtles. Human-related changes associated with coastal development include beachfront lighting, shoreline armoring, and beach driving. Shoreline hardening or armoring (e.g., seawalls) can result in the complete loss of dry sand suitable for successful nesting. Artificial lighting on and near nesting beaches can deter nesting females from coming ashore to nest and can disorient hatchlings trying to find the sea after emerging from their nests.\n\nFor Kemp\u2019s ridleys, beach driving is a threat to the turtles and the nesting habitat. Driving on nesting beaches can injure or kill nesting turtles, eggs, and hatchlings. Nesting turtles can be difficult to see and they cannot move quickly on land to avoid an approaching vehicle. Beach driving also degrades the nesting habitat by causing sand compaction and creating ruts and ridges in the sand that pose obstacles to nesting turtles and hatchlings attempting to reach the ocean, resulting in an extended period of travel or entrapment.\n\nPredation of Eggs and Hatchlings\nThe destruction and consumption of eggs and hatchlings by non-native and native predators, such as feral pigs, coyotes, raccoons, birds, and crabs is a threat to Kemp\u2019s ridley sea turtles. Predation control is an effective tool to reduce this threat and improve in situ hatching success.\n\nVessel Strikes\nVarious types of watercraft can strike sea turtles when they are at or near the surface, resulting in injury or death. Vessel strikes are a threat to sea turtles near ports,  waterways, and along developed coastlines throughout their range. High boat traffic areas such as marinas, boat ramps, and inlets present a higher risk. Adult sea turtles, in particular nesting females, are more susceptible to vessel strikes when making reproductive migrations and while they are nearshore during the nesting season or if they reside in coastal foraging habitats that may overlap in areas with high boat traffic.\n\nOcean Pollution/Marine Debris\nIncreasing pollution of nearshore and offshore marine habitats threatens all sea turtles and degrades their habitats. The Deepwater Horizon oil spill was the largest offshore oil spill in U.S. history and affected nesting (including nesting females, eggs, and hatchlings), small juvenile, large juvenile, and adult sea turtles throughout the Gulf of America. Ingestion of marine debris is another threat to all species of sea turtles. Kemp\u2019s ridley turtles may ingest fishing line, balloons, plastic bags, plastic fragments, floating tar or oil, and other materials discarded by humans which they can mistake for food. They may also become entangled in marine debris, including lost or discarded fishing gear, which can lead to injury or death.\n\nChanging Environmental Conditions\nFor all sea turtles, higher sand temperatures can be lethal to eggs or alter the ratio of male and female hatchlings produced (via temperature-dependent sex determination).  Rising seas and storm events change beach morphology and cause beach erosion, which may flood nests or wash them away. Changes in the temperature of the marine environment are likely to alter habitat suitability, as well as the abundance and distribution of food resources, leading to a shift in the migratory and foraging range and nesting season of Kemp's ridleys. Environmental conditions also can cause large sea turtle stranding events during the winter months along the northeast coast of the U.S..\n\nScientific Classification\nKingdom\tAnimalia\nPhylum\tChordata\nClass\tReptilia\nOrder\tTestudines\nFamily\tCheloniidae\nGenus\tLepidochelys\nSpecies\tkempii\nLast updated by NOAA Fisheries on 05/29/2025\n\nWhat We Do\nConservation & Management\nSince 1977, NOAA Fisheries and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) have shared jurisdiction of sea turtles under the ESA.

      "content": "Twilight is a 2008 American vampire romantic fantasy film directed by Catherine Hardwicke from a screenplay by Melissa Rosenberg, based on the 2005 novel of the same name by Stephenie Meyer. It is the first installment in The Twilight Saga film series. The film stars Kristen Stewart as Bella Swan, a teenage girl, and Robert Pattinson as Edward Cullen, a vampire. It focuses on the development of Bella and Edward's relationship and the subsequent efforts of Edward and his family to keep Bella safe from another coven of vampires.\n\nThe project was in development for approximately three years at Paramount Pictures' MTV Films, during which time a film adaptation that differed significantly from the novel was written. Summit Entertainment acquired the rights to the novel after the project's stagnant development. Rosenberg wrote a new adaptation of the novel shortly before the 2007\u20132008 Writers Guild of America strike and sought to be faithful to the novel's storyline. Principal photography began in March 2008 and took 44 days,[6] being completed in May;[7] the film was shot in the states of Oregon[8] and Washington.[9]\n\nTwilight premiered at the Mann Village Theater in Westwood, California on November 17, 2008,[10] and was theatrically released in the United States on November 21, by Summit Entertainment. Despite receiving mixed reviews from critics, the film grossed $412 million worldwide.[5] It was released on DVD and Blu-ray on March 21, 2009, and became the most purchased DVD of the year.[11] The soundtrack was released on November 4, 2008.[12]\n\nThe film was followed by four sequels: New Moon (2009), Eclipse (2010), Breaking Dawn \u2013 Part 1 (2011), and Breaking Dawn \u2013 Part 2 (2012)\n\nPlot\nSeventeen-year-old Bella Swan leaves Phoenix, Arizona and moves to Forks, a small town located on Washington state's Olympic Peninsula, to live with her father, Charlie, the town's police chief. Her mother, Ren\u00e9e, is remarried to Phil, a minor league baseball player.\n\nBella becomes re-acquainted with Jacob Black, a Native American teen who lives with his father, Billy on the Quileute Indian Reservation near Forks. At school, she finds the mysterious and aloof Cullen siblings particularly intriguing. She is seated next to Edward Cullen in biology class, but he seems repulsed by her.\n\nWhen Bella is nearly struck by a van in the school parking lot, Edward instantaneously covers a distance of over thirty feet to put himself between her and the van, stopping it with only his hand. He refuses to explain his actions to her, warning her against befriending him. Jacob tells Bella about a long-standing animosity between the Cullens and the Quileutes; the Cullens are not allowed on the reservation.\n\nWhen Edward saves Bella again, this time from a gang, after research she concludes that he is a vampire. He eventually confirms this, explaining that he found her scent irresistible back in biology class and that the Cullens only consume animal blood.\n\nThe pair fall in love and he introduces her to his vampire family. Carlisle Cullen, the patriarch, is a doctor at the Forks Hospital. Esme is his wife, and Alice, Jasper, Emmett and Rosalie are their informally-adopted children. The family's reaction to Bella is mixed, as some of the Cullens are concerned that the family's secret could be exposed.\n\nEdward and Bella's relationship is jeopardized when three nomadic vampires\u2014James, Victoria, and Laurent\u2014arrive, responsible for a series of deaths being investigated as animal attacks. James, a tracker vampire, is excited by Bella's scent and becomes obsessed with hunting her for sport. The Cullens protect Bella from the trio. Laurent chose to warn the Cullens about James, who in turn attempt to draw James away from Bella, but James manages to track her to Phoenix. She is there hiding with Jasper and Alice, and James tricks her into thinking he kidnapped her mother by luring her into her old ballet studio.\n\nJames revealed the kidnapping was a ruse as he attacks Bella, infecting her with vampire venom. The Cullens arrive and kill James, decapitating and burning him, as Edward removes the venom from Bella's wrist, preventing her from becoming a vampire.\n\nIn the aftermath, Edward accompanies an injured Bella to prom, where he refuses her request to transform her into a vampire. They are unaware that James' mate, Victoria, is watching them, plotting revenge for her lover's death.\n\nCast\nSee also: List of Twilight cast members\nKristen Stewart as Bella Swan, a seventeen-year-old girl who moves to the small town of Forks, Washington from Phoenix, Arizona and falls in love with Edward Cullen, a vampire.

After reaching the scene where Bella Swan is saved by Edward Cullen from being hit by a car, Mooradian understood the appeal of the novel. He soon brought the manuscript to David Gale, then executive vice president of Paramount Pictures' MTV Films division, to propose a film adaptation, believing the novel to be \"tailor-made\" for the MTV brand's teen audience.[26] Gale, in turn, brought it to Paramount's then co-president of production, Karen Rosenfelt, who lobbied to option the rights to the novel. MTV Films eventually acquired the rights in April of the same year and later hired Mark Lord to write a script.[27] The screenplay that was subsequently developed was substantially different from its source material, being more action-oriented. According to Lord, he originally pitched his adaptation as a vampiric take on the play Romeo and Juliet, but MTV Films \"wanted to just put in some more action to advance it more and give something more for the male audience. They thought they were going to lose the male audience with too much of a romance.\" MTV Films was pleased with the script he delivered, which included, among many changes, the character of Bella Swan being a long-distance runner, cursing, using shotguns against vampires who killed her father, being turned into a vampire, and riding a jet ski while being chased by the FBI.[26] When talking about MTV Films' original script, author Stephenie Meyer said, \"They could have filmed it and not called it Twilight because it had nothing to do with the book, and that's kind of frightening.\"[28]\n\nFollowing a change of management at Paramount Pictures, the studio's new president of production, Brad Weston, told Gale that he believed audiences were not interested in films about vampires and werewolves, after being involved with box-office bomb Cursed at Dimension Films, and development stalled.[26][29][4][30] In January 2006, Paramount put Twilight into turnaround. Rosenfelt, who had left Paramount and came aboard Twilight as a producer, was determined to make the film and attempted to forge a co-production deal between Paramount and Fox 2000 Pictures, where she had a producing deal, but Fox 2000 did not agree with Paramount's terms. Rosenfelt later tried to generate interest at Fox Atomic, but Fox Atomic passed. In October 2006, Rosenfelt met with Erik Feig, then president of production of Summit Entertainment, and mentioned to him that, of all the projects she wished she could make, she thought Twilight had the biggest potential. After their meeting, Feig obtained a copy of the novel, read it, and passed it on to colleagues at Summit, who perceived it as an opportunity to launch a franchise. When Paramount Pictures let the rights to Twilight expire in April 2007, Summit acquired them, agreeing in contract with Meyer that their film adaptation would be more faithful to the novel than MTV Films' version.[30][27][31][32][16][33][26]\n\nBefore even having the rights to Twilight, on the 2007 Sundance Film Festival, Feig talked with director Catherine Hardwicke, of whom he was a fan, about working with Summit Entertainment and sent her five scripts of films the studio was developing, including Mark Lord's draft of Twilight for MTV Films. Hardwicke did not like any of the scripts, but ended up curious about Twilight. She bought a copy of the novel and realized the script she had read had very little to do with the source material, which she soon began envisioning as a film.[26] Following Summit's acquisition of the rights, Hardwicke was set to direct the film and Melissa Rosenberg was hired to write the script in mid-2007.[34]\n\nRosenberg developed an outline by the end of August and collaborated with Hardwicke on writing the screenplay during the following month. Rosenberg said Hardwicke \"was a great sounding board and had all sorts of brilliant ideas. [...] I'd finish off scenes and send them to her, and get back her notes.\"[35] Due to the impending Writers Guild of America strike, Rosenberg worked full-time to finish the screenplay before October 31.[35] In adapting the novel, she \"had to condense a great deal.\" Some characters from the novel were not featured in the screenplay, whereas some characters were combined into others.[36] \"[O]ur intent all along was to stay true to the book\", Rosenberg explained, \"and it has to do less with adapting it word for word and more with making sure the characters' arcs and emotional journeys are the same.\"[37] Hardwicke suggested the use of voice over to convey Bella's internal dialogue[35] \u2013 since the novel is told from her point of view \u2013 and she sketched some of the storyboards during pre-production.[38]\n\nAdaptation from source material\nThe filmmakers behind Twilight worked to create a film that was as faithful to the novel as they thought possible when converting the story to another medium. Producer Greg Mooradian said, \"It's very important to distinguish that we're making a separate piece of art that obviously is going to remain very, very faithful to the book. [...] But at the same time, we have a separate responsibility to make the best movie you can make.\"[39] To ensure a faithful adaptation, Meyer was kept very involved in the production process, having been invited to visit the set during filming and even asked to give notes on the script and on a rough cut of the film.[40] Of this process, she said, \"It was a really pleasant exchange [between me and the filmmakers] from the beginning, which I think is not very typical. They were really interested in my ideas\",[41] and \"[...] they kept me in the loop and with the script, they let me see it and said, 'What are your thoughts?' [...] They let me have input on it and I think they took 90 percent of what I said and just incorporated it right into the script.\"[40] Meyer fought for one line in particular, one of the most well-known from the book about \"the lion and the lamb\", to be kept verbatim in the film: \"I actually think the way Melissa [Rosenberg] wrote it sounded better for the movie [...] but the problem is that line is actually tattooed on peoples' bodies. [...] But I said, 'You know, if you take that one and change it, that's a potential backlash situation.'\"[40] Meyer was even invited to create a written list of things that could not be changed for the film, such as giving the vampires fangs or killing characters who do not die in the book, that the studio agreed to follow in the contract.[40][41] The consensus among critics is that the filmmakers succeeded in making a film that is very faithful to its source material,[42][43] with one reviewer stating that, with a few exceptions, \"Twilight the movie is unerringly faithful to the source without being hamstrung by it.\"[44]\n\nHowever, as is most often the case with film adaptations, differences do exist between the film and source material. Certain scenes from the book were cut from the film, such as a biology room scene where Bella's class does blood typing. Hardwicke explains, \"Well [the book is] almost 500 pages\u2014you do have to do the sweetened condensed milk version of that. [...] We already have two scenes in biology: the first time they're in there and then the second time when they connect. For a film, when you condense, you don't want to keep going back to the same setting over and over. So that's not in there.\"[45] The settings of certain conversations in the book were also changed to make the scenes more \"visually dynamic\" on-screen, such as Bella's revelation that she knows Edward is a vampire\u2014this happens in a meadow in the film instead of in Edward's car as in the novel.[45] A biology field trip scene is added to the film to condense the moments of Bella's frustration at trying to explain how Edward saved her from being crushed by a van.[39] The villainous vampires are introduced earlier in the film than in the novel. Rosenberg said \"You don't really see James and the other villains until the last quarter of the book, which really won't work for a movie. You need that ominous tension right off the bat. We needed to see them and that impending danger from the start. And so I had to create a back story for them, what they were up to, to flesh them out a bit as characters.\"[35] Rosenberg also combined some of the human high school students, with Lauren Mallory and Jessica Stanley in the novel becoming the character of Jessica in the film, and a \"compilation of a couple of different human characters\" becoming Eric Yorkie.[36] About these variances from the book, Mooradian stated, \"I think we did a really judicious job of distilling [the book]. Our greatest critic, Stephenie Meyer, loves the screenplay, and that tells me that we made all the right choices in terms of what to keep and what to lose. Invariably, you're going to lose bits and pieces that certain members of the audience are going to desperately want to see, but there's just a reality that we're not making 'Twilight: The Book' the movie.\"[39]\n\nCasting\nWhen they told me Rob was probably the one, I looked him up and thought, \"Yeah, he can do a version of Edward. He's definitely got that vampire thing going on.\" And then, when I was on set and I got to watch him go from being Rob to shifting into being Edward, and he actually looked like the Edward in my head, it was a really bizarre experience. [...] He really had it nailed.\n\n\u2013Twilight author Stephenie Meyer[30]\nSeveral actresses, including Lily Collins[46] and Jennifer Lawrence,[47] screen tested for the role of Bella Swan, while Frances Bean Cobain turned down the opportunity to audition for the role.[48] Michelle Trachtenberg also turned down the part due to scheduling issues.[49] Hardwicke desired to test Kristen Stewart, who she had seen in Into the Wild and became her first choice for the part. Stewart eventually agreed to meet Hardwicke while working on Adventureland and Hardwicke visited her in Philadelphia with actor Jackson Rathbone, who was in contention to portray Edward Cullen, for an informal screen test that \"captivated\" the director.[26][4] After casting Stewart as Bella, Hardwicke had trouble finding an actor otherworldly enough to play Edward Cullen. Several actors, including Scott Eastwood[50] and Josh Peck,[51] auditioned for the role. Rathbone, Shiloh Fernandez, Ben Barnes, and Robert Pattinson were the final four up for the role.[52] Hardwicke did not initially choose Pattinson for Edward Cullen, with him arriving at her house in Venice, Los Angeles for a test, according to Hardwicke, \"kind of wild-looking\" with \"scraggly, black dyed hair, and a stain on his shirt\", while also having, according to Pattinson, a \"hairless, chubby body\" from \"drinking beer all day\" for a few months.[53] After an audition, however, where Pattinson kissed Stewart on Hardwicke's bed and fell out of it, he was selected.[26][54][4] Hardwicke said, \"Kristen was like, 'It's got to be Rob!' She felt connected to him from the first moment. That electricity, or love at first sight, or whatever it is.\" Hardwicke gave him the part, as long as he got in shape and made a promise. \"'You've got to realize that Kristen is 17 years old'\", Hardwicke told him. \"'She's underage. You've got to focus, dude, or you're going to be arrested.' I made him swear on a stack of Bibles.\"[54] Pattinson was unfamiliar with the book series prior to his test but read the books later on.[55] Meyer even allowed him to view a manuscript of the unfinished Midnight Sun, which chronicles the events in Twilight from Edward's point of view.[56] Fan reaction to Pattinson's casting as Edward was initially negative; Rachelle Lefevre remarked that \"[e]very woman had their own Edward [that] they had to let go of before they could open up to [him], which they did.\"[55] Meyer was \"excited\" and \"ecstatic\" in response to the casting of the two main characters.[57] She had expressed interest in having Emily Browning and Henry Cavill cast as Bella and Edward, respectively, prior to pre-production.[58]\n\nPeter Facinelli was chosen to play Carlisle Cullen, though he was not the first choice by Summit, revealing, \"Hardwicke liked me, but there was another actor that the studio was pushing for.\"[15] For unknown reasons, that actor was not able to play the part and Facinelli was selected in his place.[15] Elizabeth Reaser was hired as Esme Cullen, despite only knowing in the audition that the film was based on a novel.[59] Jackson Rathbone, who was in the final mix for Edward, was cast as Jasper Hale. The choice of Ashley Greene to portray Alice Cullen was the subject of fan criticism due to Greene being 7 inches (18 cm) taller than her character as described in the novel. Meyer stated previously that Rachael Leigh Cook resembled her vision of Alice.[60] Nikki Reed was cast as Rosalie Hale. Reed had previously worked with Hardwicke on Thirteen, which they wrote together, and Lords of Dogtown. Reed commented, \"I don't want to say it's a coincidence, because we do work well together, and we have a great history. I think we make good work, but it's more that the people that hire [Hardwicke] to direct a film of theirs [have] most likely seen her other work.\"[61] After an open casting call, Taylor Lautner was cast as Jacob Black.[62] Kellan Lutz was in Africa shooting the miniseries Generation Kill when the auditions for the character of Emmett Cullen were conducted. The role had already been cast by the time that pre-production ended in December 2007, but the actor who had been selected \"fell through\"; Lutz subsequently auditioned and was flown to Oregon, where Hardwicke personally chose him.[63] Rachelle Lefevre was interested in pursuing a role in the film because Hardwicke was attached to the project as director; there was also \"the potential to explore a character, hopefully, over three films\"; and she wanted to portray a vampire.[64] She \"thought that vampires were basically the best metaphor for human anxiety and questions about being alive.\"[64] Christian Serratos initially auditioned for Jessica Stanley, but she \"fell totally in love with Angela\" after reading the novels and successfully took advantage of a later opportunity to audition for Angela Weber.[65] The role of Jessica Stanley went to Anna Kendrick, who got the part after two mix-and-match auditions with various actors.[66]\n\nFilming and post-production\nPrincipal photography took 44 days,[6] after more than a week of rehearsals,[67] and completed on May 2, 2008.[7] Similar to her directorial debut Thirteen, Hardwicke opted for an extensive use of hand-held cinematography to make the film \"feel real\".[15][68] Meyer visited the production set three times and was consulted on different aspects of the story;[69] she also has a brief cameo in the film.[70] Cast members who portrayed vampires avoided sunlight to make their skin pale, though makeup was also applied for that effect, and wore contact lenses: \"We did the golden color because the Cullens have those golden eyes. And then, when we're hungry, we have to pop the black ones in,\" Facinelli explained.[15] They also participated in rehearsals with a dance choreographer and observed the physicality of different panthera to make their bodily movements more elegant.[15][60][71]\n\nScenes were filmed primarily in Portland, Oregon,[8] including at the Cullen House, a striking glass-and-wood residence.[72] Stunt work was done mainly by the cast.[73] The fight sequence between Gigandet and Pattinson's characters in a ballet studio, which was filmed during the first week of production, involved a substantial amount of wire work because the vampires in the story have superhuman strength and speed.[71] Gigandet incorporated mixed martial arts fighting moves in this sequence, which involved chicken and honey as substitutes for flesh.[74] Bella, the protagonist, is unconscious during these events, and since the novel is told from her point of view, such action sequences are illustrative and unique to the film.[55] Pattinson noted that maintaining one's center of gravity is difficult when doing wire work \"because you have to really fight against it as well as letting it do what it needs to do.\"[55] Lef\u00e8vre found the experience disorienting since the forward motion was out of her control.[55]\n\nInstead of shooting at Forks High School itself, scenes taking place at the school were filmed at Kalama High School[75] and Leodis V. McDaniel High School.[76] Other scenes were filmed in St. Helens,[77] and Hardwicke conducted some reshooting in Pasadena, California, in August.[6][78] Twilight was originally scheduled to be theatrically released in the United States on December 12, 2008, but its release date was changed to November 21 after Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince was rescheduled for an opening in July 2009.[79] Two teaser trailers, as well as some additional scenes, were released for the film, as well as a final trailer, which was released on October 9.[80][81] A 15-minute excerpt of Twilight was presented during the International Rome Film Festival in Italy.[82] The film received a rating of PG-13 from the Motion Picture Association of America for \"some violence and a scene of sensuality\".[83]\n\nAfter the film's finalization, Hardwicke published the Twilight: Director's Notebook on March 17, 2009.[84]\n\nMusic\nMain article: Twilight (soundtrack)\nThe score for Twilight was composed by Carter Burwell,[85][86] with the rest of the soundtrack chosen by music supervisor Alexandra Patsavas.[87] Meyer was consulted on the soundtrack, which includes music by Muse and Linkin Park, bands she listened to while writing the novels.[88][89] The original soundtrack was released on November 4, 2008, by Chop Shop Records in conjunction with Atlantic Records.[12] It debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200.[90]\n\nRelease\nBox office\nTwilight grossed over $7 million in ticket sales from midnight showings alone on November 21, 2008.[91] The film is fifth overall on Fandango's list of top advance ticket sales, outranked only by its sequel the following year, Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith (2005), The Dark Knight (2008), and Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2009).[91] It grossed $35.7 million on its opening day.[92] For its opening weekend in the United States and Canada, Twilight accumulated $69.6 million from 3,419 theaters at an average of $20,368 per theater.[93] The film grossed $192,769,854 in the United States and Canada, and $214,417,861 in international territories for a total of $407,187,715.[5] Its opening weekend gross was the highest ever of a female-directed film, surpassing that of Deep Impact (1998).[94]\n\nCritical reception\nBased on 223 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 48% and a weighted average score of 5.4/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \"Having lost much of its bite transitioning to the big screen, Twilight will please its devoted fans, but do little for the uninitiated.\"[95] On Metacritic, it has a weighted mean score of 56 based on 38 reviews from film critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[96] Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\u2212\" on an A+ to F scale.[97]\n\nNew York Press critic Armond White called the film \"a genuine pop classic\",[98] and praised Hardwicke for turning \"Meyer's book series into a Bront\u00eb-esque vision.\"[99] Roger Ebert gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote, \"I saw it at a sneak preview. Last time I saw a movie in that same theater, the audience welcomed it as an opportunity to catch up on gossip, texting, and laughing at private jokes. This time the audience was rapt with attention\".[100] In his review for the Los Angeles Times, Kenneth Turan wrote, \"Twilight is unabashedly a romance. All the story's inherent silliness aside, it is intent on conveying the magic of meeting that one special person you've been waiting for. Maybe it is possible to be 13 and female for a few hours after all\".[101] USA Today gave the film two out of four stars and Claudia Puig wrote, \"Meyer is said to have been involved in the production of Twilight, but her novel was substantially more absorbing than the unintentionally funny and quickly forgettable film\".[102] Entertainment Weekly gave the film a \"B\" rating and Owen Gleiberman praised Hardwicke's direction: \"She has reconjured Meyer's novel as a cloudburst mood piece filled with stormy skies, rippling hormones, and understated visual effects\".[103]\n\nStewart's performance as Bella received mixed reviews. Claudia Puig of USA Today called her acting \"wooden\" and her facial expressions throughout the film \"blank\",[104] while Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly praised her, calling her \"the ideal casting choice\" and thought she portrayed \"Bella's detachment, as well as her need to bust through it\" well.[105] Roger Ebert called Pattinson \"well-chosen\" for Edward,[106] while Manohla Dargis of The New York Times called him \"capable and exotically beautiful\".[107] Both he and Taylor Lautner, who plays Jacob, were nominated for Best Male Breakthrough Performance at the 2009 MTV Movie Awards; the award ultimately went to Pattinson.[108]\n\nIn 2025, it was one of the films voted for the \"Readers' Choice\" edition of The New York Times' list of \"The 100 Best Movies of the 21st Century,\" finishing at number 311.[109]\n\nHome media\n\nWikinews has related news:\n\"Twilight\" DVD sells 3 million copies in first day\nThe film was released on DVD in North America on March 21, 2009, through midnight release parties, and sold over 3 million units in its first day.[110] It was released on April 6, 2009, in the UK.[111][112] Bonus features include about 10 to 12 extended or deleted scenes, montages and music videos, behind-the-scenes interviews, a \"making-of\" segment, and commentary featuring Hardwicke, Stewart, and Pattinson.[113][114] The Blu-ray disc edition of the film was released on March 21, 2009, in select locations, but was made more widely available at further retailers on May 5, 2009.[115] As of July 2012, the film has sold 11,242,519 units, earning $201,190,019.[116]\n\nThe film and the next two installments of the Twilight Saga were rereleased as a triple feature with extended cuts on January 13, 2015.\n\nTwilight was released on 4K Blu-ray on October 23, 2018.[117]\n\nSame instructions as before except i dont want any lines to rhyme please and I want the poem to be about edward specifically"
