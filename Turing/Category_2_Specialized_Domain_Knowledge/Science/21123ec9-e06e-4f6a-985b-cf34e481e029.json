Birds that might breed at the Dells are noted.\n\n\n\nFollow this link to the iNaturalist field guide to Resident Birds of Winnebago County!\n\nLearn about common bird feeder visitors using this interactive Quizlet!\n\n\n\n\nAmerican Crow\n(Corvus brachyrhynchos)\n\n\nThey are very social and intelligent birds. There have been accounts where crows were seen using sticks and rocks as tools, and where groups of crows (murders) have worked together to steal food from other animals. Crows tend to be aggressive to other birds, such as hawks, and may even capture smaller birds for food. Their call is a distinct \"caw.\"\n\n\nPHOTO CREDIT: KELLY COLGAN AZAR\n\nAmerican Goldfinch\n(Spinus tristis)\n\n\nTheir diet consists strictly of seeds, but occasionally will eat an insect or two. American goldfinches live in North America year-round and are most commonly seen during winter months. They prefer to live near fields and can also be found in parks and backyards. Among the wide range of calls and songs they sing, the most common is \u201cpo-ta-to chip.\u201d \n\n\nPHOTO CREDIT: KELLY COLGAN AZAR\n\nAmerican Robin\n(Turdus migratorius)\n\n\nTypical adults range from 2.7 - 3 oz and have a 12.2 - 15.7 in. wingspan. Their diet mainly consists of insects, fruits, and earthworms. American Robins hunt for earthworms using their sense of sight, not their hearing. American Robins are among the most common North American birds; they can be found in practically all regions of the continent and in most habitats. They are a type of thrush, and are good indicators of springtime in the northern parts of the U.S. Their song is sung \u201ccheerily, cheer up, cheer up, cheerily, cheer up\u201d in a rhythmic matter.\n\nAmerican Tree Sparrow\n(Spizella arborea)\n\n\nThey can weigh from 0.5 - 1 oz and have a wingspan of about 9.4 in.

Bald Eagles can fly up to 75 \u2013 99 mph. They have a lifespan of 20 years in the wild.  Bald Eagles communicate using chirps, whistles, and harsh chatters. The chatter generally sounds like \u201ckwit-kwit-kwit-kwit\u201d or \u201ckee-kee-kee-kee-ker\u201d.\n\n\nPHOTO CREDIT: ANDY MORFLEW\n\nBarn Swallow\n(Hirundo rustica)\n\n\nThey weigh from 0.6 - 0.6 oz and have a wingspan of 11.4 - 12.6 in.

Barred Owls live in coniferous forests, wooded swamps, and wherever there is dense foliage with water nearby. These owls roost most commonly in hollow tree cavities. Perhaps the most commonly known owl call, their \u201cWho cooks for you?\u201d can be heard during the day or night. Contrary to popular belief, Barred Owls are diurnal, which means they can be active at any time throughout the whole 24-hour day, but most commonly during the evening. Known predators are raccoons and Great horned owls.\n\n\nPHOTO CREDIT: ALAN D. WILSON\n\nBlack-capped Chickadee\n(Poecile atricapillus)\n\n\nThey can weigh up to 0.5 oz. and have a wingspan of 6-8 in.

Brown-headed Cowbirds live in open areas such as fields, grasslands, and forest edges. They do not build their own nests, but practice a method that is called \u201cbrood parasitism\u201d where females lay their eggs in the nests of other birds. This behavior can be hurtful to the hosts, as many of the original chicks die. Brown-headed Cowbirds click, chatter, and whistle. \n\n\nphoto credit: rhododendrites\n\nCanada Goose\n(Branta canadensis)\n\n\nThey weigh anywhere from 7-20 lbs. and have a wingspan of 4-6 ft.
