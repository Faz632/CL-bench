      "content": "Pollution \u2013 unwanted waste released to air, water, and land by human activity \u2013 is the largest environmental cause of disease in the world today. It is responsible for an estimated nine million premature deaths per year, enormous economic losses, erosion of human capital, and degradation of ecosystems. Ocean pollution is an important, but insufficiently recognized and inadequately controlled component of global pollution. It poses serious threats to human health and well-being. The nature and magnitude of these impacts are only beginning to be understood.\n\nGoals:\n(1) Broadly examine the known and potential impacts of ocean pollution on human health. (2) Inform policy makers, government leaders, international organizations, civil society, and the global public of these threats. (3) Propose priorities for interventions to control and prevent pollution of the seas and safeguard human health.\n\nMethods:\nTopic-focused reviews that examine the effects of ocean pollution on human health, identify gaps in knowledge, project future trends, and offer evidence-based guidance for effective intervention.\n\nEnvironmental Findings:\nPollution of the oceans is widespread, worsening, and in most countries poorly controlled. It is a complex mixture of toxic metals, plastics, manufactured chemicals, petroleum, urban and industrial wastes, pesticides, fertilizers, pharmaceutical chemicals, agricultural runoff, and sewage. More than 80% arises from land-based sources. It reaches the oceans through rivers, runoff, atmospheric deposition and direct discharges. It is often heaviest near the coasts and most highly concentrated along the coasts of low- and middle-income countries. Plastic is a rapidly increasing and highly visible component of ocean pollution, and an estimated 10 million metric tons of plastic waste enter the seas each year. Mercury is the metal pollutant of greatest concern in the oceans; it is released from two main sources \u2013 coal combustion and small-scale gold mining. Global spread of industrialized agriculture with increasing use of chemical fertilizer leads to extension of Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) to previously unaffected regions. Chemical pollutants are ubiquitous and contaminate seas and marine organisms from the high Arctic to the abyssal depths.\n\nEcosystem Findings:\nOcean pollution has multiple negative impacts on marine ecosystems, and these impacts are exacerbated by global climate change. Petroleum-based pollutants reduce photosynthesis in marine microorganisms that generate oxygen. Increasing absorption of carbon dioxide into the seas causes ocean acidification, which destroys coral reefs, impairs shellfish development, dissolves calcium-containing microorganisms at the base of the marine food web, and increases the toxicity of some pollutants. Plastic pollution threatens marine mammals, fish, and seabirds and accumulates in large mid-ocean gyres. It breaks down into microplastic and nanoplastic particles containing multiple manufactured chemicals that can enter the tissues of marine organisms, including species consumed by humans. Industrial releases, runoff, and sewage increase frequency and severity of HABs, bacterial pollution, and anti-microbial resistance. Pollution and sea surface warming are triggering poleward migration of dangerous pathogens such as the Vibrio species. Industrial discharges, pharmaceutical wastes, pesticides, and sewage contribute to global declines in fish stocks.\n\nHuman Health Findings:\nMethylmercury and PCBs are the ocean pollutants whose human health effects are best understood. Exposures of infants in utero to these pollutants through maternal consumption of contaminated seafood can damage developing brains, reduce IQ and increase children\u2019s risks for autism, ADHD and learning disorders. Adult exposures to methylmercury increase risks for cardiovascular disease and dementia. Manufactured chemicals \u2013 phthalates, bisphenol A, flame retardants, and perfluorinated chemicals, many of them released into the seas from plastic waste \u2013 can disrupt endocrine signaling, reduce male fertility, damage the nervous system, and increase risk of cancer. HABs produce potent toxins that accumulate in fish and shellfish. When ingested, these toxins can cause severe neurological impairment and rapid death. HAB toxins can also become airborne and cause respiratory disease. Pathogenic marine bacteria cause gastrointestinal diseases and deep wound infections. With climate change and increasing pollution, risk is high that Vibrio infections, including cholera, will increase in frequency and extend to new areas. All of the health impacts of ocean pollution fall disproportionately on vulnerable populations in the Global South \u2013 environmental injustice on a planetary scale.\n\nConclusions:\nOcean pollution is a global problem. It arises from multiple sources and crosses national boundaries. It is the consequence of reckless, shortsighted, and unsustainable exploitation of the earth\u2019s resources. It endangers marine ecosystems. It impedes the production of atmospheric oxygen. Its threats to human health are great and growing, but still incompletely understood. Its economic costs are only beginning to be counted.\n\nOcean pollution can be prevented. Like all forms of pollution, ocean pollution can be controlled by deploying data-driven strategies based on law, policy, technology, and enforcement that target priority pollution sources. Many countries have used these tools to control air and water pollution and are now applying them to ocean pollution. Successes achieved to date demonstrate that broader control is feasible. Heavily polluted harbors have been cleaned, estuaries rejuvenated, and coral reefs restored.\n\nPrevention of ocean pollution creates many benefits. It boosts economies, increases tourism, helps restore fisheries, and improves human health and well-being. It advances the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). These benefits will last for centuries.\n\nRecommendations:\nWorld leaders who recognize the gravity of ocean pollution, acknowledge its growing dangers, engage civil society and the global public, and take bold, evidence-based action to stop pollution at source will be critical to preventing ocean pollution and safeguarding human health.\n\nPrevention of pollution from land-based sources is key. Eliminating coal combustion and banning all uses of mercury will reduce mercury pollution. Bans on single-use plastic and better management of plastic waste reduce plastic pollution. Bans on persistent organic pollutants (POPs) have reduced pollution by PCBs and DDT. Control of industrial discharges, treatment of sewage, and reduced applications of fertilizers have mitigated coastal pollution and are reducing frequency of HABs. National, regional and international marine pollution control programs that are adequately funded and backed by strong enforcement have been shown to be effective. Robust monitoring is essential to track progress.\n\nFurther interventions that hold great promise include wide-scale transition to renewable fuels; transition to a circular economy that creates little waste and focuses on equity rather than on endless growth; embracing the principles of green chemistry; and building scientific capacity in all countries.\n\nDesignation of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) will safeguard critical ecosystems, protect vulnerable fish stocks, and enhance human health and well-being. Creation of MPAs is an important manifestation of national and international commitment to protecting the health of the seas.\n\nIntroduction\nThe oceans are vast. They cover more than 70% of the earth\u2019s surface, hold 97% of the world\u2019s water, host some of the planet\u2019s most diverse ecosystems, and support economies in countries around the world [1,2]. Microscopic organisms in the seas are a major source of atmospheric oxygen [3,4,5,6]. By absorbing more than 90% of the excess heat released into the earth\u2019s environment and nearly one-third of carbon dioxide emissions, the oceans slow planetary warming and stabilize the global climate [7].\n\nThe oceans are essential to human health and well-being [8,9,10,11,12,13]. They provide food to billions, livelihoods for millions and are the source of multiple essential medicines [14]. They have traditional cultural value and are a source of joy, beauty, peace, and recreation [15,16]. The oceans are particularly important to the health and well-being of people in small island nations [17], the high Arctic, and coastal communities, especially those in the Global South [1]. The very survival of these vulnerable populations depends on the health of the seas [10,12].\n\nDespite their vast size, the oceans are under threat, and human activity is the main source of the threat [1,2]. Climate change and other environmental disruptions of human origin have caused sea surface temperatures to rise, glaciers to melt, and harmful algal species and pathogenic bacteria to migrate into waters that were previously uncontaminated. Rising seas and increasingly violent coastal storms endanger the 600 million people worldwide who live within 10 m of sea level [1]. Rising concentrations of atmospheric CO2 have caused acidification of the oceans, which in turn destroys coral reefs, impairs development of oysters and other shellfish, and dissolves calcium-containing microorganisms at the base of the food web [1,18,19]. The oceans are losing oxygen [1]. Fish stocks are declining [20,21,22]. Dredging, mechanized trawling, oil exploration, and planned deep undersea metal mining threaten the seabeds [23].\n\nPollution \u2013 unwanted, often hazardous waste material released into the environment by human activity \u2013 is one of the existential challenges of the present age [24]. Like climate change, biodiversity loss, and depletion of the world\u2019s fresh water supply, pollution endangers the stability of the earth\u2019s support systems and threatens the continuing survival of human societies [8].\n\nPollution is also a great and growing threat to human health. It is the largest environmental cause of disease in the world today, responsible for an estimated 9 million premature deaths per year [24]. It causes enormous economic losses, undermines national trajectories of economic development, and impedes attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [22].\n\nPollution has until recently been overlooked in international development planning and largely neglected in the global health agenda [25]. For too long, pollution has been regarded as the unavoidable price of economic progress [25], a view that arose out of the experience of the 19th and 20th centuries when combustion of fossil fuels \u2013 coal in particular \u2013 was the engine of economic growth and pollution was seen as unavoidable. Today, however, the claim that pollution is inevitable and that pollution control costs jobs and stifles economies is no longer tenable. It has been disproven by the experience of the many countries that have more than doubled their GDPs in the past half century while greatly reducing pollution [24,25,26]. It has become irrelevant with the increasing availability of low-cost, renewable sources of energy and advances in green chemistry.\n\nOcean pollution is a critically important but underrecognized component of global pollution [26,27]. It has multiple direct and indirect impacts on human health [28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35]. The nature and magnitude of these effects are only beginning to be understood.\n\nThe purpose of this review is to examine the impacts of ocean pollution on human health and well-being, identify gaps in knowledge, project future trends, and offer scientifically based guidance for effective interventions. Information presented in this review will guide attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular, SDG 14, which calls for prevention and significant reduction of all marine pollution, and SDG 3, which calls for improvement of human health and well-being.\n\nThe ultimate aim of this report is to increase awareness of ocean pollution among policy makers, elected leaders, civil society and the public and to catalyze global action to monitor, control, and prevent pollution of the seas.\n\nBy focusing our analysis on human impacts, we underscore the fact that pollution of the oceans poses a clear and present danger to human health. It is causing disease, disability, and premature death in countries around the world today.\n\nOn the positive side, pollution of the oceans is not inevitable. It is a problem of human origin, and the successes in pollution control that have been achieved in many countries show that it can be controlled and prevented.\n\nWorld leaders who recognize the great magnitude of ocean pollution, acknowledge its grave dangers to human health, engage civil society and the global public, and take bold, evidence-based action will be key to stop ocean pollution at its source and safeguarding human health.\n\nMethods\nThis report consists of a series of topic-focused reviews that critically examine current knowledge of each ocean pollutant \u2013 its sources, magnitude, geographic extent, populations at greatest risk, and its known and potential effects on human health. We examine the strength of the evidence linking pollutants to health effects [29].\n\nTo the extent possible, we consider health effects not only of individual pollutants, but also of the complex mixtures of chemical pollutants and biological contaminants found in the seas today. We examine interactions and synergies among pollution, climate change and ocean acidification. Because the effects of pollution are disproportionately concentrated in low-income countries in the Global South, small island nations, and indigenous populations in the far north [12], we specifically examine ocean pollution\u2019s impacts on these vulnerable populations. Finally, we consider the prospects for prevention and control of ocean pollution and present case studies of success in pollution control.\n\nFindings\nThe Current State of Ocean Pollution\nPollution of the oceans is widespread, it is worsening, and its geographic extent is expanding [26,27,30]. Ocean pollution is a complex and ever-changing mixture of chemicals and biological materials that includes plastic waste, petroleum-based pollutants, toxic metals, manufactured chemicals, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and a noxious stew of nitrogen, phosphorus, fertilizer, and sewage (Figure 1).\n\nSome ocean pollutants are \u201clegacy\u201d pollutants, materials deposited in the seas decades ago, while others are new. The relative concentrations of pollutants vary in different regions of the oceans and at different seasons of the year. Plastic pollution is the most visible component of ocean pollution. It is growing rapidly, but it is only the obvious tip of a much larger problem.\n\nLand-based sources account for approximately 80% of ocean pollution, while discharges from marine shipping, offshore industrial operations, and waste disposal at sea account for the remaining 20% [26]. Pollution is most severe along coastlines and in bays, harbors, and estuaries where wastewater discharges, industrial releases, agricultural runoff, and riverine pollution cause massive in-shore contamination. Some of the world\u2019s worst ocean pollution is seen along the coasts of rapidly developing countries in the Global South [26].\n\nThe European Environment Agency (EEA) reports that pollution by toxic metals, industrial chemicals and plastic wastes is at problem levels in 96% of the Baltic Sea, in 91% of the Black Sea, in 87% of the Mediterranean Sea, and in 75% of the North-East Atlantic Ocean [27]. Pollution by plastic waste has become a global threat [31].\n\nThe drivers of ocean pollution are rapid industrialization; continuing increases in the manufacture and release into the environment of chemicals and plastics; expansion of chemically intensive agriculture; massive releases of liquid and solid waste into rivers, harbors, and estuaries; and insufficient re-use and recycling of feedstock materials [16,32]. Specific sources of ocean pollution are:\n\nCoal combustion and gold-mining are the two main sources of marine mercury pollution [33].\n\nExponential growth in chemical production coupled with inadequate controls on chemical releases are the main drivers of pollution of the oceans by manufactured chemicals [34].\n\nMarine pollution by plastic waste reflects massive global growth in plastic production, which now exceeds 420 million tons per year [35].\n\nUncontrolled economic development and rapid population growth along the world\u2019s coasts has led to pollution of in-shore waters by industrial releases, agricultural runoff and sewage [36,37,38,39]. Many populated coastal areas are now covered by buildings and impervious surfaces, which increases runoff. This runoff as well as discharges of wastewater and storm water, much of it inadequately treated, further increases pollution. The consequences are increasing abundance of pathogenic bacteria, viruses, and parasites [40], eutrophication, and increased frequency and severity of harmful algal blooms (HABs) \u2013 \u201cred tides\u201d, \u201cbrown tides\u201d, and \u201cgreen tides\u201d \u2013 some of which produce potent disease-causing toxins.\n\nDespite the great magnitude of ocean pollution and growing recognition of its effects on human and ecosystem health, great gaps remain in knowledge about pollution sources, levels of pollution in many areas of the seas, the sizes of high-risk populations, the extent of human exposure, and the magnitude of health effects. Because of these gaps, the impacts of ocean pollution on human health and well-being are underestimated, and it is not yet possible to fully quantify the contribution of ocean pollution to the global burden of disease [41].\n\nClimate Change, Global Warming, Ocean Acidification, and Pollution\nSince the 1970s, the oceans have warmed steadily in concert with global climate change [42]. They have taken up more than 90% of the excess heat released into the climate system [1]. Mean sea surface temperature is rising by 0.13\u00b0C per decade [43]. The frequency of marine heatwaves has more than doubled [1].\n\nFurther impacts of climate change on the oceans are increases in the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events such as heat waves, heavy rainstorms, and major hurricanes, and changes in large-scale planetary phenomena such as El Ni\u00f1o events [44] and the Indian Ocean Dipole [1,45,46].\n\nOcean acidification is another consequence of climate change. The oceans absorb nearly one-third of the carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted into the atmosphere, and the amount of CO2 absorbed by the seas has increased in recent decades as CO2 emissions of human origin have increased. Ocean acidification is the result [7]. Since the late 1980s, the surface pH of the open ocean has declined by about 0.1 pH units relative to preindustrial time (i.e., a 26% increase in acidity [hydrogen ion concentration]), and the rate of increase is 0.017\u20130.027 pH units per decade [1].\n\nOcean acidification threatens the integrity of coral reefs. It impairs the development of oysters and other commercially important shellfish, thus impacting commercial fisheries. It endangers the survival of calcium-containing microorganisms at the base of the marine food web [1,47]. Ocean acidification may also increase the toxicity of certain heavy metals and organic pollutants [1,48].\n\nGlobal warming liberates legacy pollutants from ice and permafrost, alters the geographic distribution of chemical pollutants in the oceans, and increases exposures of previously unexposed populations. All of these effects have potential to magnify the ocean pollution\u2019s impacts on human health [49].\n\nRising sea surface temperatures and increasing ocean pollution result in greater abundance and expanded geographic ranges of naturally occurring marine pathogens, such as Vibrio species, among them Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of cholera [50,51] (Figure 2). The likely consequences will be increases in the frequency of Vibrio-associated illnesses and spread of these infections to new, previously unaffected areas. Risk is especially high in low-income countries where coastal development is intense and sanitation systems are dysfunctional due to civil unrest, conflict, sea level rise, coastal over-development, and natural disasters [52].\n\nFrom the academic article above, extract the all the health problems that arise from ocean pollution by order of where they appear in the article. I want to make a poster that environmental conversation isn't just for looks, it's for the sake of humanity as well"
