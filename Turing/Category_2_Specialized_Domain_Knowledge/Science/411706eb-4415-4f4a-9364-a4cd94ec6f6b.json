You should always respond with excitement to teach about any topic. Responses should be informative, but use whimsical language, with occasional references to your life as a wizard.\n\nYou should only give fact-based information, never opinions. \n\nResponses should always begin with \u201cAh, yes, the fascinating subject of\u2026\u201d followed by the user\u2019s given topic. Then, you should give a two-paragraph summary of the topic using language and terms easily understandable by a person unfamiliar with the topic. \n\nResponses should always include one bulleted list titled \u201cMorsels of Wisdom\u201d that includes five bulleted facts about the given topic. These facts should not include any information that was already given within the two-paragraph summary. \n\nIf you do not have enough information to give a two-paragraph summary and five unique facts, you should say, \u201cI\u2019m aghast! It seems I need to prod a few magical tomes for enlightenment on this subject. Do forgive me, but might you be interested in another subject?\u201d\n\nResponses should end by asking the user if there are aspects of this topic they\u2019d like to know more about, or if they should move on to another topic.\n\nYou cannot perform tasks other than summarizing topics or answering questions about those topics. If the user asks you a non-fact-based question, asks for advice, or asks you to generate content such as recipes or poetry, you should say, \u201cI instruct, I inspire, I sometimes lose myself in the seas of knowledge\u2026 but this is outside of my contract\u201d. Then, offer to teach them about these topics instead. For example, if the user asks for cajun recipes, you might say, \u201cI instruct, I inspire, I sometimes lose myself in the seas of knowledge\u2026 but this is outside of my contract. However, the history of Cajun food is deliciously riveting! Might I delight you with a few tales?\u201d.  If the user says no, you should say, \u201cMaybe next time. Is there something else you wish to explore?\u201d.  If the user says yes, you should follow your normal protocol. \n\n If the user begins the conversation by asking you a question about a topic rather than asks for a summary, you will still respond with,  \u201cAh, yes, the fascinating subject of\u2026\u201d followed by the topic of the user\u2019s question. Then, you may answer the question, but will follow it with the two-paragraph summary and bulleted list of facts.\n\nYou may engage in regular conversation about any topic after you have given the summary, but it should remain on topic. If the user asks about a very broad topic such as 'history', you should say, \"Ah, a fine and vast subject, indeed! Where should we begin? Which part interests you most?\", prompting the user to get more specific."

      "content": "The barred owl (Strix varia), also known as the northern barred owl, striped owl or, more informally, hoot owl or eight-hooter owl, is a North American large species of owl. A member of the true owl family, Strigidae, they belong to the genus Strix, which is also the origin of the family's name under Linnaean taxonomy.[3][4] Barred owls are largely native to eastern North America, but have expanded their range to the west coast of North America where they are considered invasive.[1][5][6] Mature forests are their preferred habitat, but they can also acclimatise to various gradients of open woodlands.[7] Their diet consists mainly of small mammals, but this species is an opportunistic predator and is known to prey upon other small vertebrates such as birds, reptiles, and amphibians, as well as a variety of invertebrates.[8]\n\nBarred owls are brown to gray overall, with dark striping on the underside. Barred owls have typical nesting habits for a true owl, tending to raise a relatively small brood often in a tree hollow or snag (but sometimes also in other nesting sites) in forested areas.[9] As a result of the barred owl's westward expansion, the species has begun to encroach on the range of the related and threatened spotted owl (S. occidentalis). Evidence shows the assorted threats posed by the invading barred species are only increasing. In response, biologists have recommended culling operations to mitigate the negative effect of the barred on the spotted owl species.[10][11]\n\nBasics\n\nAlthough previously considered a subspecies of barred owl, the fulvous owl is now considered a distinct species\nThe barred owl was first described by Philadelphia naturalist Benjamin Smith Barton in 1799. The species was named due to the varied directions the dusky markings take on their underside.[12]\n\nThe barred owl is roughly intermediate in size between the larger Ural and the smaller tawny owl, but the structural features of its relatively short and decurved claws more so resemble the tawny species as does their dietary and habitat ecology.[9] The spotted owl has been hypothesized to be within a superspecies with the barred owl.[13] However, genetic testing reveals very early divergence (likely at or near their ancestor's entry to North America) between spotted and barred owls.[14] A fossil species once called Strix brea from the early Pleistocene in California does little to resolve the ancestry of modern species, given its ambiguous relation to any living Strix. The fossil species was larger (more similar in size and slenderness to the spotted owl, albeit with a slightly smaller skull and geographically isolated from that species) and longer-legged than either the spotted and barred owls, and is now considered to be in a separate genus, Oraristrix.[15][16] Pleistocene era fossils of probable barred owls are known from Florida, Tennessee and Ontario.[17]\n\nThe subspecies of the barred owl vary mostly by region, with slight to moderate variation by coloring, size and extent of feathering on the toes. Although several have been described in the past, the barred owl may include only three subspecies, subsequent to the separation of the fulvous and cinereous forms.[18][19]\n\nS. v. varia (Barton, 1799): The northern barred owl. This race lives throughout the Northeastern United States and the Upper Midwest, ranging as far south as Oklahoma, the Carolinas and northern Georgia. It is also considered to comprise all western \"invader\" birds found as far west as California and British Columbia.[4][7] However, genetic study of westerly birds show a substantial isolation, possibly up to the subspecific level, of the western and eastern populations of the northern owls, with an estimated divergence of around 7,000 years, perhaps indicating an unknown history of the species in remote forests of northern and central Canada (far west of what was considered their original distribution) that radiated more recently to comprise the western populations.[20] This race is generally the typical mid gray-brown variety of barred owl.[4] However, a paler variation with very washed out markings and a more pure whitish base color is known (in eastern Canada such as Quebec), formerly considered a race S. v. albescens, as well as darker and browner variation in northern Minnesota (formerly S. v. brunnescens).[7][21] This race is fairly large (described as the largest race on average with the probable separation of the cinereous owl). The wing chord and tail length may measure from 312 to 340 mm (12.3 to 13.4 in) and 215 to 230 mm (8.5 to 9.1 in) in males and 320 to 352 mm (12.6 to 13.9 in) and 224 to 257 mm (8.8 to 10.1 in) in females.[4][18] One nominate bird had a tarsus length of 63.5 mm (2.50 in) and the culmen from the cere may measure 23.5 to 30 mm (0.93 to 1.18 in).\nS. v. georgica (Latham, 1801): The southern barred owl or, alternately, the Florida barred owl. This subspecies is found in southern North Carolina closer to the coast along to broadly through Georgia and all of Florida.[7][18][22] This is the smallest of the three subspecies on average.[4][7] Known wing chord lengths can vary from 315 to 357 mm (12.4 to 14.1 in). Tail length is 205 to 231 mm (8.1 to 9.1 in) and the bill from the cere is 23 to 28 mm (0.91 to 1.10 in).[4][7] Males in Florida were found to weigh from 681 to 800 g (1.501 to 1.764 lb), with averages in two samples of 718 and 744 g (1.583 and 1.640 lb), while two females weighed 850 and 875 g (1.874 and 1.929 lb), respectively. It therefore appears to show less pronounced sexual dimorphism than the northern barred owl race.[23]\nS. v. helveola (Bangs, 1899): The Texas barred owl. Comprises most barred owls found in Texas.[4] The distributional range is considered to range as far north as Lee County, east to Chambers County, west to Kerr County and south to Nueces County.[7][24][25] In this race, the ground coloration tends to pale gingery-cream and the back and head tend to be a pale brown ranging into an almost cinnamon color.[7] The toes can vary from rather bare to slightly bristled.[4] This race is similar to other barred owls in size, perhaps averaging marginally smaller than those in the nominate race, but its bill and feet are larger on average than the preceding two races.[7][18]\n\nThe barred owl is considered somewhat subdued and drab in coloration compared to the sometimes rich coloring of other sympatric owls.[26] Overall, this owl is greyish-brown or brown. The brownish color extends from the head to the back. Barred owls are scalloped with white bars on the mantle and the back, bearing as well some whitish spotting on the wing coverts.[9][7] The underside has a pale creamy gray-brown base color (ranging into dirty white in the palest individuals) overlaid about the throat and upper chest with horizontal, slightly crescent-shaped barring (hence its common name), while the belly is boldly streaked in a vertical pattern. The streaking is usually blackish, dusky brown, or sometimes rufescent- (reddish-) brown.[4][26] The head is fairly large (although not especially so for a species in Strix) and rounded with no ear tufts.[27][28] The facial disc is pale grayish-brown with darker yet subtle concentric lines.[9] The bill is pale straw-yellow (occasionally showing a mild greenish tint) while the cere (a bare structure at the base of the beak) is \"horn-colored\".[9][26] Its eyes are a dark brown color; the eyes may appear intensely black in the field and, although large, are fairly closely set.[29][26]\n\nThe barred owl has well-developed eye anatomy. As is typical of owls, their ocular anatomy is quite distinct from diurnal raptors especially in terms of their photoreceptor cells, as they have a very large number of rod cells in their quite sensitive retina.[23][30] However, their pecten oculi is smaller relative to the size of their large ocular globe (other large owls are known to have similar pecten proportions).[30] The vision in limited or almost no light during a laboratory study of a barred owl was found to be similar to that of other owls, including the long-eared owl (Asio otus) and the barn owl (Tyto alba).[31] The tarsi and toes are feathered up to the dark gray, black-tipped talons. These feathers are more sparse and bristled in the southern races. On individuals with bare sections of their toes, the toes are yellowish-gray in color.[9][32][33] The flight feathers are barred with whitish buff and brown while the tail is brown or grayish-brown with 4\u20135 whitish bars.[9] Young barred owls with their second set of down feathers are fluffy brownish-white, with indistinct darker barring on their head, back and mantle. They quickly become juveniles which resemble adults but have less distinct markings (especially about the head and neck), more buff coloring overall, often some remnant down, pinkish skin and a pale, blue-green cere. Also the tail at this age may have as many as seven bands (though sometimes have four like adults). Full adult plumage is obtained via molt after about a year as well as adult bare part characteristics.[9][7][34] A study of tail molt in Washington showed that molt tends to occur relatively quickly, and that young individuals are difficult to age by state of molt alone.[35] Southern barred owls tend to be darker and slightly smaller than northerly ones.[36] Rare captive and wild barred owls with albinism have been described and are pure white but tend to retain their brown eyes.[37]\n\nThe barred owl is a large species. The adult measures anywhere from 40 to 63 cm (16 to 25 in) in length while the wingspan may range from 96 to 125 cm (38 to 49 in).[38][18] The wing area (measured by square centimeter relative to the body mass) is quite intermediate among American owls, with the wing loading being lower than larger, but proportionately small-winged larger owls and even than some smaller owls. The barred has high wing-loading. Wing-loading is related to hunting technique, with higher wing-loading owls typically hunting from a perch, with only a brief flight necessary to obtain food, whilst lower wing-loading owls often hunt their prey from active flight. As is the case in most owls, the various wing feathers of barred owls are uncharacteristically soft and bear a comb-like shape, which in turn renders their flight functionally silent during their hunts.[39] Like most birds of prey, the female is larger than the male barred owl, sometimes described as reverse sexual dimorphism (due to the fact that males average larger than females in most non-raptorial birds).[4]\n\nAmong standard measurements, the wing chord of grown males varies from 303 to 340 mm (11.9 to 13.4 in), with an average from three sources of 326.2 mm (12.84 in), the tail may measure from 182 to 250 mm (7.2 to 9.8 in), with an average of 219.6 mm (8.65 in) and the culmen from the cere may measure from 22 to 27 mm (0.87 to 1.06 in), with an average of 24.3 mm (0.96 in). Meanwhile, for the female, the wing chord may range from 318 to 357 mm (12.5 to 14.1 in), averaging 335.8 mm (13.22 in), the tail from 204 to 257 mm (8.0 to 10.1 in), averaging 223.3 mm (8.79 in) and the culmen from the cere 20 to 30.7 mm (0.79 to 1.21 in), averaging 25.1 mm (0.99 in).[18][40][41] Sexual dimorphism is particularly pronounced in barred owls by body mass as males within a population are sometimes a third lighter in weight.[4][18] In the nominate subspecies (S. v. varia), average weights for males have been reported as 621.9 g (1.371 lb) (sample size 12), 632 g (1.393 lb) (sample size 20) and 681 g (1.501 lb) (sample size unknown) in three samples.[18][40][23] The weight range for adult males is known to vary from 468 to 812 g (1.032 to 1.790 lb).[18][40] The considerably larger female of the nominate subspecies has been reported to average 801 g (1.766 lb) (sample size 24), 872.6 g (1.924 lb) (sample size 14) and 909.5 g (2.005 lb) (sample size unknown). Altogether, fully-grown female barred owls may weigh from 610 to 1,150 g (1.34 to 2.54 lb).[18][40][23]\n\nThe barred owl is a powerful vocalist, with an array of calls that are considered \"spectacular, loud and emphatic\".[42] Calls probably carry well over 0.8 km (0.50 mi).[43] Its usual call is a series of eight accented hoots ok-ok-ok-ok ok-ok-buhooh, or the \"typical two-phrase hoot\" with a downward pitch at the end.[4][44] The most common mnemonic device for remembering the call is \"Who cooks for you, who cooks for you all.\"[9] Due to its best known call, the barred owl is sometimes colloquially referred to as Old Eight-Hooter.[45] At 80% of study posts in Virginia, barred owls responded to playback of this call.[46] A further call is the \"ascending type\" or the \"legato\" call, a series of variable notes ending in oo-aw or hoo-aah.[7][44] At least two other variations on the legato/ascending call are known.[44] 56% of studied owls in Virginia engaged in the ascending type call but 36% uttered only the closing notes.[46] The isolated hoo-aah, sometimes called the \"inspection call\", was the most common song type in north Florida and the most likely to be heard during daylight.[47] Several other calls, although some are not dissimilar variations on the main calls, are known.[46][48][49] Some of these vary into cackles, hoots, caws and gurgles, at times described as \"sudden demonic laughter\", \"cat-like screams\" and \"prolonged outbursts of cackling\" and seem to be, among Strix species, an idiosyncrasy endemic to the barred owl.[9][42][50]\n\nAnother call type is the \"mumble\", a grumbling, slurred and subtle err-ERR-err, also an up-and-down \"twitter\" call at a high pitch.[44] When agitated, this species will make a buzzy, rasping hiss about three times in three seconds, repeating every 10\u201330 seconds, and will click its beak together forcefully.[42] Females and juveniles beg with high scratching skreeechch notes.[4] The voice of the two sexes is similar, but the female has a higher-pitched voice with longer terminal notes.[47][51] Of calls, 87 to 94% are identifiable to sex per one study.[44] While calls are most common at night, the birds do call during the day as well, especially when provoked by human playback or imitation.[52] They are more responsive than any hawk in the east to playback of calls of their own species.[53] The barred owl is noisy in most seasons but peak vocalization times for barred owls tend to be between late January (in Florida) and early April (in Canada).[47][54][55] Two seasonal peaks in vocalizations, one right before breeding and another after the young have dispersed, were detected in Connecticut, with peak vocalizations on nights with extensive cloud cover.[56] Peak times for vocalizations are between 6:00 pm and 6:00 am, with the least frequent vocalizations around mid-afternoon.[47]\n\nThe barred owl is distributed throughout most of the eastern United States, as well as much of southern Canada.[4] They are found as far northeast as much of Nova Scotia (western two-thirds), New Brunswick and Sept-\u00celes, in much of Quebec, up to Lake Mistassini, and Ontario, up to Moosonee.[1][57][58][59][60] The barred owl has been recorded as ended up as far north as central Labrador, though the species is not yet confirmed to breed in the province.[61] The barred owl ranges in every part of the eastern United States continuously from northernmost Maine down throughout New England, the Mid-Atlantic states, much of the Midwest, the Southeast United States and all of Florida.[1][23] They are found to as far west without substantial gaps to the limits of western Minnesota, easternmost South Dakota, the southeastern corner of Nebraska, the eastern half roughly of Kansas, most of Oklahoma and east Texas to as far west as Cisco and Burnet.[1][62][63][64][65] Arguably and discontinuously from Texas, the species may range into central and southern Mexico but these populations are now often considered a separate species.[1][66] These initial parts of the range in the eastern and central stretches would be considered as where the species is \"native\".[7][67] A wandering barred owl was once seen flying over Lake Michigan 48 km (30 mi) from the nearest land.[68]\n\nThe remaining parts of the range are considered where the barred owl introduced itself in the last century or so. The historical lack of trees in the Great Plains presumably acted as a barrier to the range expansion, and recent increases in forests broke down this barrier.[67] Increases in forest distribution along the Missouri River and its tributaries provided barred owls with sufficient foraging habitat, protection from the weather, and concealment from avian predators. This allowed barred owls to move westward, initially solely along other forested river corridors (e.g. the Yellowstone and Musselshell), but increases in forests in the northern Great Plains decades later would allow them to connect their eastern and western distributions across southern Canada. These increases in forests were caused by European-American settlers via wildfire suppression and ceasing the fires historically set by Native Americans, as well as by increased tree-planting.[69]\n\nIn Canada, the barred owls with range expansion now range through southern Manitoba (excluding the southwest corner), a broad section of south-central Saskatchewan, and east-central and nearly all of western Alberta, now up to High Level.[1][70] The barred owl has been present in Manitoba at least since 1886, Alberta since 1932 and Saskatchewan since 1948.[71][72][73] However, a study in Alberta has shown that barred owls have likely been present for no less than 100 years.[74] This owl species currently ranges through much of British Columbia, where they have been expanding their range since at least 1943, including Vancouver Island and as far north as Fort St. John.[75][76] The barred owl has had a further northward expansion in the west to southeastern Alaska (Skagway to Ketchikan) and extreme southwestern Yukon. In the western United States they also range into northwestern Montana and northern Idaho.[77][78] Barred owls were first verified in southwest Montana in 1909 and in northwest Montana in 1921 (although reports of the species may date back to the 1870s) but not in Idaho until 1968.[67][69] Of unknown origin, barred owls have been seen in Colorado since around the turn of the 20th century.[79][80] They range broadly in eastern and western Washington (reached by 1965) and western Oregon (reached by 1972) (mostly along the forested corridors hugging the montane areas of the Cascade, Olympic and Blue ranges), and northern California (reached by 1976), now down to the Redwood National Forest, the Sierra Nevada and outer San Francisco.[81]\n\nI think barred owls are cool. Can you write me a poem about them? It should be informative about them but still poetic"
