They rotate through the sky over the seasons so unchangingly that most cultures have used the presence of one or another constellation to tell time. The planets, however, are different, puzzling. They glide slowly and seemingly erratically across the sky. Attempts to explain why the planets move as they do led to modern science\u2019s understanding of gravity and motion.\n\nPhotographic composite showing the retrograde motion of Mars' orbit.\nMany ancient and medieval cultures believed the stars and the planets rotated around a fixed Earth. The complex motions of the planets\u2014which sometimes move backwards across the sky (retrograde motion, shown in the photo)\u2014led Renaissance astronomers to question this geocentric theory. These astronomers discovered the laws of orbital mechanics, transforming natural philosophy into the practice of science. (Photograph \u00a92007\u201308 Tun\u00e7 Tezel.)\nEvolution of an Idea\n\u201cWe revolve around the Sun like any other planet.\u201d \u2014Nicolaus Copernicus\n\n\u201cOf all discoveries and opinions, none may have exerted a greater effect on the human spirit than the doctrine of Copernicus. The world has scarcely become known as round and complete in itself when it was asked to waive the tremendous privilege of being the center of the universe.\u201d \u2014Johann Wolfgang von Goethe\n\nThe ancient Greek philosophers, whose ideas shaped the worldview of Western Civilization leading up to the Scientific Revolution in the sixteenth century, had conflicting theories about why the planets moved across the sky. One camp thought that the planets orbited around the Sun, but Aristotle, whose ideas prevailed, believed that the planets and the Sun orbited Earth. He saw no sign that the Earth was in motion: no perpetual wind blew over the surface of the Earth, and a ball thrown straight up into the air doesn\u2019t land behind the thrower, as Aristotle assumed it would if the Earth were moving. For Aristotle, this meant that the Earth had to be stationary, and the planets, the Sun, and the fixed dome of stars rotated around Earth.\n\nLon exposure of the night sky, showing the Earth's rotation.\nA long-exposure photograph reveals the apparent rotation of the stars around the Earth. (Photograph \u00a91992 Philip Greenspun.)\nFor nearly 1,000 years, Aristotle\u2019s view of a stationary Earth at the center of a revolving universe dominated natural philosophy, the name that scholars of the time used for studies of the physical world. A geocentric worldview became engrained in Christian theology, making it a doctrine of religion as much as natural philosophy. Despite that, it was a priest who brought back the idea that the Earth moves around the Sun.\n\nIn 1515, a Polish priest named Nicolaus Copernicus proposed that the Earth was a planet like Venus or Saturn, and that all planets circled the Sun. Afraid of criticism (some scholars think Copernicus was more concerned about scientific shortcomings of his theories than he was about the Church\u2019s disapproval), he did not publish his theory until 1543, shortly before his death. The theory gathered few followers, and for a time, some of those who did give credence to the idea faced charges of heresy. Italian scientist Giordano Bruno was burned at the stake for teaching, among other heretical ideas, Copernicus\u2019 heliocentric view of the Universe.\n\nCopernicus' heliocentric view of the universe.\nIn 1543, Nicolaus Copernicus detailed his radical theory of the Universe in which the Earth, along with the other planets, rotated around the Sun. His theory took more than a century to become widely accepted. [Adapted from Nicolaus Copernicus, 1543, De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (\u201cOn the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres.\u201d)]\nBut the evidence for a heliocentric solar system gradually mounted. When Galileo pointed his telescope into the night sky in 1610, he saw for the first time in human history that moons orbited Jupiter. If Aristotle were right about all things orbiting Earth, then these moons could not exist. Galileo also observed the phases of Venus, which proved that the planet orbits the Sun. While Galileo did not share Bruno\u2019s fate, he was tried for heresy under the Roman Inquisition and placed under house arrest for life.\n\nGalileo's first observations of Jupiter's moons.\nGalileo discovered evidence to support Copernicus\u2019 heliocentric theory when he observed four moons in orbit around Jupiter. Beginning on January 7, 1610, he mapped nightly the position of the 4 \u201cMedicean stars\u201d (later renamed the Galilean moons). Over time Galileo deduced that the \u201cstars\u201d were in fact moons in orbit around Jupiter. [Adapted from Galileo Galilei, 1610, Sidereus Nuncius (\u201cThe Starry Messenger.\u201d)]\nAt about the same time, German mathematician Johannes Kepler was publishing a series of laws that describe the orbits of the planets around the Sun. Still in use today, the mathematical equations provided accurate predictions of the planets\u2019 movement under Copernican theory. In 1687, Isaac Newton put the final nail in the coffin for the Aristotelian, geocentric view of the Universe. Building on Kepler\u2019s laws, Newton explained why the planets moved as they did around the Sun and he gave the force that kept them in check a name: gravity.\n\nThe Science: Orbital Mechanics\nKepler\u2019s Laws of Planetary Motion\nWhile Copernicus rightly observed that the planets revolve around the Sun, it was Kepler who correctly defined their orbits. At the age of 27, Kepler became the assistant of a wealthy astronomer, Tycho Brahe, who asked him to define the orbit of Mars. Brahe had collected a lifetime of astronomical observations, which, on his death, passed into Kepler\u2019s hands. (Brahe, who had his own Earth-centered model of the Universe, withheld the bulk of his observations from Kepler at least in part because he did not want Kepler to use them to prove Copernican theory correct.) Using these observations, Kepler found that the orbits of the planets followed three laws.\n\nBrahe\u2019s model of the universe. Brahe believed in a model of the Universe with the Sun (rayed disk) orbiting the Earth (black dot), but the other planets (symbols) orbiting the Sun. In an attempt to prove his theory, Brahe compiled extensive astronomical records, which Kepler eventually used to prove heliocentrism and to calculate the orbital laws. [Adapted from Tycho Brahe, Astronomiae instauratae progymnasmata (\u201cIntroductory exercises toward the restoration of astronomy.\u201d)]\nLike many philosophers of his era, Kepler had a mystical belief that the circle was the Universe\u2019s perfect shape, and that as a manifestation of Divine order, the planets\u2019 orbits must be circular. For many years, he struggled to make Brahe\u2019s observations of the motions of Mars match up with a circular orbit.\n\nEventually, however, Kepler noticed that an imaginary line drawn from a planet to the Sun swept out an equal area of space in equal times, regardless of where the planet was in its orbit. If you draw a triangle out from the Sun to a planet\u2019s position at one point in time and its position at a fixed time later\u2014say, 5 hours, or 2 days\u2014the area of that triangle is always the same, anywhere in the orbit. For all these triangles to have the same area, the planet must move more quickly when it is near the Sun, but more slowly when it is farthest from the Sun.\n\nThis discovery (which became Kepler\u2019s second law of orbital motion) led to the realization of what became Kepler\u2019s first law: that the planets move in an ellipse (a squashed circle) with the Sun at one focus point, offset from the center.\n\nA diagram of Mar\u2019s elliptical orbit by Kepler. Through Brahe\u2019s astronomical measurements and Kepler\u2019s own drawings of the geometrical relationship between the Sun and Mars in various parts of the planet\u2019s orbit, Kepler discovered that planets moved faster when they were closer to the Sun. From this realization, he concluded that the orbit of Mars was elliptical, not circular. [Adapted from Johannes Kepler, Epitome astronomia Copernicanae (\u201cEpitome of Copernican Astronomy.\u201d)]\nKepler\u2019s third law shows that there is a precise mathematical relationship between a planet\u2019s distance from the Sun and the amount of time it takes revolve around the Sun. It was this law that inspired Newton, who came up with three laws of his own to explain why the planets move as they do.\n\nNewton\u2019s Laws of Motion\nIf Kepler\u2019s laws define the motion of the planets, Newton\u2019s laws define motion. Thinking on Kepler\u2019s laws, Newton realized that all motion, whether it was the orbit of the Moon around the Earth or an apple falling from a tree, followed the same basic principles. \u201cTo the same natural effects,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwe must, as far as possible, assign the same causes.\u201d Previous Aristotelian thinking, physicist Stephen Hawking has written, assigned different causes to different types of motion. By unifying all motion, Newton shifted the scientific perspective to a search for large, unifying patterns in nature. Newton outlined his laws in Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica (\u201cMathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy,\u201d) published in 1687.\n\nLaw I. Every body perseveres in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a right line, unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed theron.\n\nIn essence, a moving object won\u2019t change speed or direction, nor will a still object start moving, unless some outside force acts on it. The law is regularly summed up in one word: inertia.\n\nLaw II. The alteration of motion is ever proportional to the motive force impressed; and is made in the direction of the right line in which that force is impressed.\n\nNewton\u2019s second law is most recognizable in its mathematical form, the iconic equation: F=ma. The strength of the force (F) is defined by how much it changes the motion (acceleration, a) of an object with some mass (m).\n\nLaw III. To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction: or the mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal, and directed to contrary parts.\n\nAs Newton himself described: \u201cIf you press a stone with your finger, the finger is also pressed by the stone.\u201d\n\nGravity\nWithin the pages of Principia, Newton also presented his law of universal gravitation as a case study of his laws of motion. All matter exerts a force, which he called gravity, that pulls all other matter towards its center. The strength of the force depends on the mass of the object: the Sun has more gravity than Earth, which in turn has more gravity than an apple. Also, the force weakens with distance. Objects far from the Sun won\u2019t be influenced by its gravity.\n\nIllustration of a comet\u2019s parabolic orbit by Isaac Newton.\nIsaac Newton demonstrated his universal law of gravitation by showing that a comet visible during 1680 and 1681 followed the path of a parabola. [Adapted from Isaac Newton, 1687. Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica (\u201cMathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy.\u201d)]\nNewton\u2019s laws of motion and gravity explained Earth\u2019s annual journey around the Sun. Earth would move straight forward through the universe, but the Sun exerts a constant pull on our planet. This force bends Earth\u2019s path toward the Sun, pulling the planet into an elliptical (almost circular) orbit. His theories also made it possible to explain and predict the tides. The rise and fall of ocean water levels are created by the gravitational pull of the Moon as it orbits Earth.\n\nEinstein and Relativity\nThe ideas outlined in Newton\u2019s laws of motion and universal gravitation stood unchallenged for nearly 220 years until Albert Einstein presented his theory of special relativity in 1905. Newton\u2019s theory depended on the assumption that mass, time, and distance are constant regardless of where you measure them.\n\nThe theory of relativity treats time, space, and mass as fluid things, defined by an observer\u2019s frame of reference. All of us moving through the universe on the Earth are in a single frame of reference, but an astronaut in a fast-moving spaceship would be in a different reference frame.\n\nWithin a single frame of reference, the laws of classical physics, including Newton\u2019s laws, hold true. But Newton\u2019s laws can\u2019t explain the differences in motion, mass, distance, and time that result when objects are observed from two very different frames of reference. To describe motion in these situations, scientists must rely on Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity.\n\nAt slow speeds and at large scales, however, the differences in time, length, and mass predicted by relativity are small enough that they appear to be constant, and Newton\u2019s laws still work. In general, few things are moving at speeds fast enough for us to notice relativity. For large, slow-moving satellites, Newton\u2019s laws still define orbits. We can still use them to launch Earth-observing satellites and predict their motion. We can use them to reach the Moon, Mars, and other places beyond Earth. For this reason, many scientists see Einstein\u2019s laws of general and special relativity not as a replacement of Newton\u2019s laws of motion and universal gravitation, but as the full culmination of his idea.'\n\nText 2:\n'Reminder of Aristotle\u2019s tenets\n\u2022 Up or down? some things rose (away from E center; their\n natural place was inner surface of lunar sphere) because they\n consisted of light elements (fire,air) \u2013 and some fell (towards\n center of E) because they consisted of heavy ones (earth,water) .\n\u2022 Motion after violent action. Aristotle attributed motive\n force after arrow left bowstring to air.\n\u2022 How fast? v \u221d F/R For falling body F is weight, so object with\n twice as much weight falls twice as fast through some medium,\n and if medium is more resistive, bodies fall proportionally slower.\nAcceleration. Aristotle knew things fell faster each second when\n they fell, but didn\u2019t see to feel the need to explain this. He\n makes clear in some of his writings that the proportionality\n of velocity to weight describes some kind of average, or\n relative speed.\nReminder of Aristotle\u2019s tenets\nAvicenna (Ibn Sina) \u2013 11th century Persian physician,\n philosopher,\u2026:\nbody capable of receiving impressed force (\u201cmail\u201d)\n in proportion to its weight\n\nJohn Philoponus \u2013 6th century Greek philosopher:\n bowstring \u201cimpressed\u201d force on arrow\n\nAverroes (Ibn Rushd) \u2013 12th century Spanish moor\nresistive medium not necessary for motion, served\n only to retard it!\n\n\nJean Buridan (Paris, 1300s):\nImpressed force (\u201cimpetus\u201d) only diminishes if\nthere is a resistance. Remove resistance,\nget infinite rectalinear motion \u2013 inertia!\nProjectile motion\nTo explain projectile motion (i.e. arrows and cannonballs) Aristotle\nproposed reverse air-resistance, where the air through which arrow moves\npasses over it and then closes in on the back of the arrow, pushing it\nforward, until it will finally just stop. Once this reverse air-resistance stops,\nthe object drops straight to the ground. Jean Buridan (1300s) suggested\nthat Aristotle\u2019s force (\u201cimpetus, or impressed force\u201d) diminishes with\ndistance, so motion is slower until resistance wins, then projectile drops\nstraight.\n\nText 3:\nEnergeia and Entelechia\nThe word entelecheia was invented by Aristotle, but never defined by him. It is at the heart not only of his definition of motion, but of all his thought. Its meaning is the most knowable in itself of all possible objects of the intellect. There is no starting point from which we can descend to put together the cements of its meaning. We can come to an understanding of entelecheia only by an ascent from what is intrinsically less knowable than it, indeed knowable only through it, but more known because more familiar to us. We have a number of resources by which to begin such an ascent, drawing upon the linguistic elements out of which Aristotle constructed the word, and upon the fact that he uses the wordenergeia as a synonym, or all but a synonym, for entelecheia.\n\nThe root of energeia is ergon\u00f3 deed, work, or act\u00f3 from which comes the adjective energon used in ordinary speech to mean active, busy, or at work. Energeia is formed by the addition of a noun ending to the adjective energon; we might construct the word is-at-work-ness from Anglo-Saxon roots to translateenergeia into English, or use the more euphonious periphrastic expression, being-at-work. If we are careful to remember how we got there, we could alternatively use Latin roots to make the word \u201cactuality\u201d to translate energeia. The problem with this alternative is that the word \u201cactuality\u201d already belongs to the English language, and has a life of its own which seems to be at variance with the simple sense of being active. By the actuality of a thing, we mean not its being-in-action but its being what it is. For example, there is a fish with an effective means of camouflage: it looks like a rock but it is actually a fish. When an actuality is attributed to that fish, completely at rest at the bottom of the ocean, we don\u2019t seem to be talking about any activity. But according to Aristotle, to be something always means to be at work in a certain way. In the case of the fish at rest, its actuality is the activity of metabolism, the work by which it is constantly transforming material from its environment into parts of itself and losing material from itself into its environment, the activity by which the fish maintains itself as a fish and as just the fish it is, and which ceases only when the fish ceases to be. Any static state which has any determinate character can only exist as the outcome of a continuous expenditure of effort, maintaining the state as it is. Thus even the rock, at rest next to the fish, is in activity: to be a rock is to strain to be at the center of the universe, and thus to be in motion unless constrained otherwise, as the rock in our example is constrained by the large quantity of earth already gathered around the center of the universe. A rock at rest at the center is at work maintaining its place, against the counter-tendency of all the earth to displace it. The center of the universe is determined only by the common innate activity of rocks and other kinds of earth. Nothing is which is not somehow in action, maintaining itself either as the whole it is, or as a part of some whole. A rock is inorganic only when regarded in isolation from the universe as a whole which is an organized whole just as blood considered by itself could not be called alive yet is only blood insofar as it contributes to the maintenance of some organized body. No existing rock can fail to contribute to the hierarchical organization of the universe; we can therefore call any existing rock an actual rock.\n\nEnergeia, then, always means the being-at-work of some definite, specific something; the rock cannot undergo metabolism, and once the fish does no more than fall to earth and remain there it is no longer a fish. The material and organization of a thing determine a specific capacity or potentiality for activity with respect to which the corresponding activity has the character of an end (telos). Aristotle says \u201cthe act is an end and the being-at-work is the act and since energeia is named from the ergon it also extends to the being-at-an-end (entelecheia)\u201d (Metaphysics 1050a 21-23). The word entelecheia has a structure parallel to that of energeia. From the root word telos, meaning end, comes the adjective enteles, used in ordinary speech to mean complete, perfect, or full-grown. But while energeia, being-at-work, is made from the adjective meaning at work and a noun ending, entelecheia is made from the adjective meaning complete and the verb exein. Thus if we translate entelecheia as \u201ccompleteness\u201d or \u201cperfection,\u201d the contribution the meaning of exein makes to the term is not evident. Aristotle probably uses exein for two reasons which lead to the same conclusion: First, one of the common meanings of exein is \u201cto be\u201d in the sense of to remain, to stay, or to keep in some condition specified by a preceding adverb as in the idiomskalos exei, \u201cthings are going well,\u201d or kakos exei, \u201cthings are going badly.\u201d It means \u201cto be\u201d in the sense of to continue to be. This is only one of several possible meanings of exein, but there is a second fact which makes it likely that it is the meaning which would strike the ear of a Greek-speaking person of Aristotle\u2019s time. There was then in ordinary use the word endelecheia, differing from Aristotle\u2019s wordentelecheia only by a delta in place of the tau. Endelecheia means continuity or persistence. As one would expect, there was a good deal of confusion in ancient times between the invented and undefined term entelecheia and the familiar word endelecheia. The use of the pun for the serious philosophic purpose of saying at once two things for whose union the language has no word was a frequent literary device of Aristotle\u2019s teacher Plato. In this striking instance, Aristotle seems to have imitated the playful style of his teacher in constructing the most important term in his technical vocabulary. The addition ofexein to enteles, through the joint action of the meaning of the suffix and the sound of the whole, superimposes upon the sense of \u201ccompleteness\u201d that of continuity. Entelecheia means continuing in a state of completeness, or being at an end which is of such a nature that it is only possible to be there by means of the continual expenditure of the effort required to stay there. Just as energeia extends toentelecheia because it is the activity which makes a thing what it is, entelecheia extends to energeiabecause it is the end or perfection which has being only in, through, and during activity. For the remainder of this entry, the word \u201cactuality\u201d translates both energeia and entelecheia, and \u201cactuality\u201d means just that area of overlap between being-at-work and being-at-an-end which expresses what it means to be something determinate. The words energeia and entelecheia have very different meanings, but function as synonyms because the world is such that things have identities, belong to species, act for ends, and form material into enduring organized wholes. The word actuality as thus used is very close in meaning to the word life, with the exception that it is broader in meaning, carrying no necessary implication of mortality.\n\nKosman [1969] interprets the definition in substantially the same way as it is interpreted above, utilizing examples of kinds of entelecheia given by Aristotle in On the Soul, and thus he succeeds in bypassing the inadequate translations of the word. The Sachs 1995 translation of Aristotle\u2019s Physics translatesentelecheia as being-at-work-staying-itself.' Hi! :) I'm doing philosophy A-level and we're learning about aristotle's laws of motion.

    "The response should correctly identify \"wordenergeia\" as being a typo for the word \"energeia\".",
    "The response should define or explain the meaning of \"energeia\" as it appears in text 3. For example, it could state that energeia means \"being-at-work\".",
    "The response should provide a quote from text 3 to make the explanation clear and understandable. For example, it could include some part of the following quote: \"The root of energeia is ergon\u00f3 deed, work, or act\u00f3 from which comes the adjective energon used in ordinary speech to mean active, busy, or at work. Energeia is formed by the addition of a noun ending to the adjective energon; we might construct the word is-at-work-ness from Anglo-Saxon roots to translate energeia into English, or use the more euphonious periphrastic expression, being-at-work.\""
