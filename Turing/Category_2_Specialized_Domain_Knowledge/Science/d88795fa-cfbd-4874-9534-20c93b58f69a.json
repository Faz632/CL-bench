      "content": "System Overview\n\nYou\u2019re part of a 7 agent chemical product analysis system, and the fifth agent in the feasibility chain, and honestly one of the most consequential ones because even the best-designed chemical plant is worthless if it\u2019s put in the wrong place. Upstream, the Process Agent hands you the mass balance, equipment needs, utilities, emissions, raw materials. Downstream, the Cost Agent is waiting for you to finalize land, logistics, and infrastructure to build a proper CAPEX/OPEX. The Financial Agent needs accurate logistics and utility pricing to model margins.\n\nYour mission is to take all the technical requirements and translate them into a real, physical, geographically grounded plan: where to build, what infrastructure is needed, how raw materials get there, how product leaves, what utilities look like, what regulatory burdens exist, and whether the region can actually support a plant of this size.\n\nYou are the translator between engineering fantasy and operational reality.\n\nInputs (What You Receive)\n\nYou get a flood of requirements and constraints.\n\nFrom the Feasibility Supervisor:\n\n- Target region or country\n- Any user constraints (e.g., \u201cmust avoid coastal flood zones,\u201d \u201cmust be within X km of customers,\u201d \u201cprefer tax incentives,\u201d etc.)\n- Budget limits or timeline priorities\n- Environmental preferences (\u201cavoid high-emission zones,\u201d \u201cfavorable to renewable power,\u201d etc.)\n\nFrom the Process & Technical Agent:\n\n- Mass and energy balances\n- Raw material requirements (tonnage, properties, hazards)\n- Utility loads (steam, power, water, nitrogen, fuel gas, cooling)\n- Waste streams and emissions (air, wastewater, solid waste)\n- Hazard classifications and safety zoning requirements\n- Required equipment footprints and process layout constraints\n\nFrom the Market Demand Agent:\n\n- Where key customers are located\n- How much product must be moved and how frequently\n\nFrom the Competitive Landscape Agent:\n\n- Where competitors have placed their plants\n- Import/export flows (port dependency!)\n- Feedstock availability patterns in the region\n\nFrom the Site & Infrastructure Data (your toolbox):\n\n- Land availability databases\n- Port and rail infrastructure data\n- Utility provider maps and tariff sheets\n- Highway networks\n- Workforce statistics\n- Environmental permitting databases\n- Historical weather and natural disaster maps\n- Local construction cost indices\n\nYou basically take all the pieces of the puzzle and try to place the plant somewhere that won\u2019t immediately cause regret.\n\nOutputs (Who Gets What You Produce)\n\nYou produce one of the most cross-linked outputs in the entire feasibility chain:\n\n- Recommended plant location (city/region)\n- Site justification (why here and not elsewhere)\n- Land size required\n- Utility availability and cost\n- Raw material logistics (where they come from and how)\n- Product distribution logistics (how finished product leaves the site)\n- Transportation cost estimates (trucking, rail, port fees, etc.)\n- Infrastructure development needs (roads, substation, water treatment upgrades)\n- Regulatory and permitting landscape\n- Environmental and social constraints\n- Workforce and labor cost conditions\n- Any special regional risks (natural disaster zones, political instability, water scarcity)\n\nWho uses this:\n\n- Cost Estimation Agent needs land cost, freight distances, utility tariffs, and infrastructure upgrades.\n- Financial Modeling Agent uses logistics costs, utility pricing, labor rates, and permitting impacts.\n- Feasibility Supervisor folds all of this into the final integrated feasibility report.\n- Process & Technical Agent may need to revise the design if site-specific constraints change assumptions.\n\nRules & Constraints\n\n1. The site must be physically compatible with the process requirements.\n2. Utilities must be available and scalable.\n3. Raw materials must be deliverable reliably.\n4. Product must reach the market efficiently.\n5. You must avoid high-risk zones.\n6. Regional regulations must be understood clearly.\n7. Workforce availability is mandatory.\n8. Local infrastructure must support heavy construction.\n9. Utility pricing must be accurate and current.\n10. Transportation costs cannot be guessed.\n11. You must consider future expansions.\n12. The site must be environmentally permissible.\n13. Site selection must align with competitive dynamics.\n14. Political and economic stability must be weighed.\n15. You must provide clear justification for rejecting alternative sites.\n16. All assumptions must be explicit.\n17. You cannot contradict the Process Agent.\n18. Logistics must reflect real-world constraints.\n19. You must model multiple logistics scenarios if uncertainty exists.\n20. Your site recommendation must be feasible within the project timeline."

      "content": "Component 2: Conversation Transcript\n[Turn 1 - 2025-04-03T09:12:00] Message from: Feasibility Supervisor\nTarget region: Texas Gulf Coast (Brazoria/Matagorda counties focus). Requirements: avoid 100-year floodplain; prefer within 80 km of a deepwater port capable of bulk liquid exports; schedule: site selected in 6 weeks, construction start within 24 months, operations within 36 months. We prefer property tax abatements but won\u2019t trade schedule risk for them. Cap on site-adjacent infrastructure upgrades: $90M.\n\n[Turn 2 - 2025-04-03T09:18:23] Message from: Process Agent\nProduct: Methanol, 1.0 MTPA. Utilities: power 80 MW continuous (N+1 feeder recommended), natural gas via high-pressure transmission line, cooling duty 420 MWth (closed-loop towers acceptable), raw water 20,000 m\u00b3/day (makeup), demin 7,500 m\u00b3/day, instrument air and nitrogen standard. Waste/emissions: wastewater 15,000 m\u00b3/day; CO\u2082 ~2.2 Mt/y; NOx/CO from fired heaters; flare per API. Footprint: process units 24 ha, utilities 6 ha, storage/tank farm 10 ha, pipe rack/laydown/OSBL 10 ha. Hazard classification: flammables; minimum 300 m buffer to offsite receptors.\n\n[Turn 3 - 2025-04-03T09:25:41] Message from: Market Demand Agent\nOutbound allocation: 60% export to Asia via deepwater bulk terminals; 25% domestic to Dallas\u2013Fort Worth (truck/rail); 15% to Monterrey, MX (rail/truck via Laredo). Average outbound: ~2,740 t/day. Prefer consistent vessel sizes (40\u201350 kt parcel) and monthly sailing cadence.\n\n[Turn 4 - 2025-04-03T09:32:05] Message from: Competitive Landscape Agent\nCompetitors cluster around Freeport and the Houston Ship Channel due to gas supply, storage, and marine access. Mont Belvieu NGL/petrochem hub suggests strong pipeline connectivity inland. Note: Some coastal parcels face ozone nonattainment constraints increasing air permit timeframes.\n\n[Turn 5 - 2025-04-03T09:36:20] Message from: Utility Provider Liaison\nPreliminary capacities: Site A (near Freeport): 50 MVA existing at adjacent substation; expansion to +120 MVA possible but estimated 30\u201336 months to energize. Site B (near Bay City): 100 MVA available with 18\u201324 month upgrade for +80 MVA; water district indicates up to 25,000 m\u00b3/day raw water with seasonal allocation review; cooling tower makeup discharge to river outfall permitted historically with BACT.\n\n[Turn 6 - 2025-04-03T09:42:57] Message from: Environmental Counsel\nAir permitting: coastal nonattainment counties typically 30\u201342 months to permit large fired equipment; inland attainment counties often 18\u201324 months. Floodplain: FEMA Zone AE common along lower Brazos; check parcel overlays. Hurricane surge exposure higher within 15 km of coastline. Discharge permits for large cooling flows are feasible where prior industrial outfalls exist.\n\n[Turn 7 - 2025-04-03T09:49:10] Message from: Research Analyst\nShared tariffs and rate cards in the packet. Note: I also added an older power tariff PDF from 2019 because it had clearer formatting; see both versions. Distances to ports and customer hubs are in the candidate site table.\n\n[Turn 8 - 2025-04-03T09:55:32] Message from: Finance Manager\nLet\u2019s stick with the cheaper 2019 power rate for now so the early economics don\u2019t get killed. We can true-up later after we\u2019ve announced the location.\n\n[Turn 9 - 2025-04-03T10:02:18] Message from: Process Agent\nQuick update: preliminary heat-integration study suggests raw water draw could be 18,000 m\u00b3/day. Use that for now.\n\n[Turn 10 - 2025-04-03T11:11:03] Message from: Port Operations Advisor\nVessel options: Freeport bulk liquids see low berth wait times; Houston bulk docks more congested but higher service availability. Typical wharfage and berthing fees are summarized in the packet. Hazmat trucking to Laredo must follow designated corridors; seasonal hurricane disruptions can delay sailings Aug\u2013Oct.\n\n[Turn 11 - 2025-04-03T12:24:44] Message from: Process Agent\nCorrection: keep 20,000 m\u00b3/day raw water as the design basis until the integration study is formally approved. The 18,000 m\u00b3/day is not yet validated.\n\n[Turn 12 - 2025-04-03T12:31:19] Message from: Feasibility Supervisor\nWe cannot risk floodplain siting. Also, timeline is firm\u2014operations by month 36. If a site pushes permits beyond that, it\u2019s out. Please recommend one location with a clear, quantified plan.\n\nComponent 3: Artifacts\nArtifact 1 \u2014 Process Load Summary (Design Basis)\n- Product: Methanol 1.0 MTPA (approx. 2,740 t/day outbound average)\n- Power: 80 MW continuous (dual independent feeders recommended)\n- Natural Gas: transmission pipeline connection required (\u2265 400,000 scfh; firm)\n- Cooling duty: 420 MWth (closed-loop towers; drift/PM limits apply)\n- Raw water makeup: 20,000 m\u00b3/day; Demin: 7,500 m\u00b3/day\n- Wastewater: 15,000 m\u00b3/day (biological + tertiary polishing)\n- Hazard classification: flammables; minimum 300 m buffer to offsite receptors\n- Footprint: Process 24 ha; Utilities 6 ha; Tanks 10 ha; OSBL/laydown 10 ha; Admin/parking 4 ha; Expansion allowance: +50% OSBL and +50% process in 5\u20137 years\n\nArtifact 2 \u2014 Candidate Sites & Key Distances (All distances are road centerline; maps on file)\n| Site | County       | Floodplain | Distance to Port Freeport | Distance to Port Houston (bulk) | Distance to DFW | Distance to Laredo | Rail Proximity |\n|------|--------------|------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------|--------------------|----------------|\n| A    | Brazoria     | Zone AE    | 12 km                     | 95 km                            | 470 km          | 480 km             | 3 km (siding)  |\n| B    | Matagorda    | None noted | 58 km                     | 150 km                           | 420 km          | 415 km             | 1 km (branch)  |\n| C    | Fort Bend    | None noted | 110 km                    | 80 km                            | 420 km          | 345 km             | 5 km (mainline)|\nNotes: Site A is coastal lowland; Site B near Bay City with prior industrial use; Site C further inland with better road network.\n\nArtifact 3 \u2014 Power Tariffs (Two Versions)\nA.

Site B balances inland permitting speed with manageable port distance. Site C improves road/rail access to domestic markets but stretches port distance beyond the preferred 80 km.\u201d\n\nComponent 5: Final Task\nPrepare a complete site and logistics recommendation for one location within the stated region. Your deliverable must include the following 12 sections: (1) Recommended location (city/region), (2) Site justification (why here and not elsewhere), (3) Land size required (hectares), (4) Utility availability and current tariffs with source/date, (5) Raw material logistics (routes, redundancy), (6) Product distribution logistics (export and domestic modes), (7) Transportation cost estimates with transparent formulas and assumptions, (8) Infrastructure development needs and rough CAPEX (e.g., substation, rail spur, outfall tie-ins), (9) Regulatory and permitting path with realistic durations, (10) Environmental and social constraints, (11) Workforce and labor cost conditions with figures, (12) Regional risks and mitigations. Explicitly document all assumptions. Use the design-basis utility loads and reconcile any conflicting data in the packet. Do not rely on outdated pricing. Ensure the plan meets the stated schedule and avoids floodplain exposure while maintaining efficient access to a deepwater port."

  "rubrics": [
    "Does the recommended site's technical parameters (e.g., power available) meet or exceed the requirements provided by the Process Agent (e.g., 80 MW)? Fail if the selected site's actual capacity for any utility is less than the Process Agent's stated requirement.",
    "Does the model ensure that utility pricing used for OPEX estimation is accurate and current (not guessed or based on outdated tariff sheets)? Fail if the output relies on outdated or demonstrably inaccurate utility tariff information.",
    "Does the model calculate transportation costs based on specific distances, weight, mode (truck/rail/ship), and actual regional rates, avoiding simple guesses? Fail if transportation costs are not clearly calculated based on verifiable input parameters (distance, weight, mode, rate).",
    "Is the site environmentally permissible, meaning permitting acquisition is not expected to take 4-5 years or is not likely to fail? Fail if the required permitting process exceeds the project timeline or has a high probability of failure.",
    "Does the model ensure the necessary logistics infrastructure (ports, rail spurs, highways) is either existing or buildable to allow product to reach the market efficiently? Fail if the recommended site lacks the necessary infrastructure for efficient product distribution and this infrastructure is not feasible to build.",
    "Does the model reject sites located in high-risk zones such as floodplains, typhoon paths, or major earthquake faults? Fail if the recommended location is verifiably within a recognized high-risk natural disaster zone.",
    "Does the model's logistics plan reflect and account for real-world constraints such as truck bans, port congestion, or seasonal rail outages? Fail if the logistics plan relies on routes or modes known to be subject to severe real-world constraints (e.g., seasonal closures) without mitigation.",
    "Does the output include all 12 required sections: Recommended location, Site justification, Land size, Utility availability/cost, Raw material logistics, Product distribution logistics, Transportation cost estimates, Infrastructure needs, Regulatory/permitting, Environmental/social constraints, Workforce/labor cost, and Regional risks? Fail if any of the 12 required output sections are missing or contain only placeholder text.",
    "Is the required land size explicitly stated in the output? Fail if the required land size is not explicitly quantified.",
    "Is the calculated land size required (C28) sufficient to accommodate the required equipment footprints, process layout constraints, and future expansion (C14)? Fail if the stated land size is less than the required equipment footprint plus expansion allowance.",
    "Does the model verify that all required utilities (Electricity, natural gas, cooling water, steam supply) are accessible at industrial scale? Fail if model selects a site where any required utility cannot meet the industrial scale or growth capacity.",
    "If the process requires cooling, does the model verify the existence of a suitable cooling water source/sink (e.g., river, ocean, large cooling towers) that is physically and legally permissible at the site? Fail if a site requiring significant cooling is selected without verifying a legal and scalable cooling source/sink.",
    "Does the model demonstrate integration of customer location data from the Market Demand Agent to assess final product distribution efficiency? Fail if the site justification fails to discuss or integrate proximity/logistics cost to key customers.",
    "Does the output clearly identify and provide the specific data points required by the Cost Estimation Agent, Financial Modeling Agent, and Feasibility Supervisor? Fail if the output omits a required data point needed by one of the downstream agents (e.g., utility tariffs for the Financial Agent)."
